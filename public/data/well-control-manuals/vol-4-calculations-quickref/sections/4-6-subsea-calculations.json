      "title": "Choke Line Friction",
      "content": "**Purpose:**\nAccounts for pressure loss in long choke line from subsea BOP to surface.\n\n**Estimation:**\nDepends on:\n- Choke line length (water depth + rig configuration)\n- Choke line ID\n- Mud weight and rheology\n- Flow rate\n\n**Determination:**\n1. Circulate down DP, up choke line\n2. Record pump pressure at kill rate\n3. Subtract normal annulus friction = choke line friction\n\n**Typical Values:**\n- 3,000 ft water depth: 200-400 psi\n- 6,000 ft water depth: 400-800 psi\n- 10,000 ft water depth: 600-1200+ psi\n\n**Impact:**\nReduce expected surface casing pressure by choke line friction during kill."

      "title": "Riser Margin",
      "content": "**Formula:**\n```\nRiser Margin = (MW - SW) × Water Depth ÷ TVD\n```\n\nWhere:\n- MW = current mud weight\n- SW = seawater weight (8.55 ppg typically)\n\n**Purpose:**\nIf riser disconnects, loss of mud in riser reduces BHP. Riser margin compensates.\n\n**Example:**\nWater depth = 5,000 ft\nTVD = 15,000 ft\nCurrent MW = 12.0 ppg\n\nRiser Margin = (12.0 - 8.55) × 5,000 ÷ 15,000\nRiser Margin = 3.45 × 0.333 = 1.15 ppg\n\nIf riser disconnects, effective mud weight at TD would drop by ~1.15 ppg.\n\n**Application:**\nCarry mud weight 1.15 ppg above minimum to maintain balance if riser lost."
