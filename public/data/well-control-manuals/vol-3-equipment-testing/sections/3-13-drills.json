      "content": "**Why Drills Matter:**\n- Build automatic responses\n- Verify crew competency\n- Identify equipment issues\n- Maintain readiness\n- Meet regulatory requirements\n\n**Key Principle:**\nA well control event is not the time to learn procedures. Drills ensure the crew can respond effectively when it matters."

      "title": "Types of Drills",
      "content": "**Pit Drill:**\n- Simulate pit gain\n- Test detection and initial response\n- Verify monitoring systems\n- Quick drill, minimal disruption\n\n**BOP/Shut-In Drill:**\n- Practice shut-in procedure\n- May include actual BOP operation\n- Test crew coordination\n- Time and evaluate response\n\n**Scenario Drill:**\n- Full well control scenario\n- Includes kill sheet completion\n- May simulate entire kill operation\n- Tests decision-making\n\n**Trip Drill:**\n- Practice tripping shut-in\n- Include FOSV installation\n- Different starting positions\n\n**Diverter Drill:**\n- Practice shallow gas response\n- Diverter activation\n- Evacuation procedures"

      "title": "Frequency",
      "content": "**Minimum Requirements:**\n- Weekly: At least one drill type\n- Per tour: New crew members participate\n- Each crew: Both crews must drill\n\n**Typical Schedule:**\n- Pit drill: Weekly\n- Shut-in drill: Weekly, rotating scenarios\n- Full scenario: Monthly or per well section\n- Trip drill: Before major trips\n- Diverter drill: When diverter is primary equipment\n\n**Regulatory:**\n- Specific requirements vary by jurisdiction\n- May specify minimum types and frequency\n- Document all drills"

      "title": "Conducting Drills",
      "content": "**Planning:**\n- Select drill type and scenario\n- Brief drill conductor\n- Ensure equipment available for drill\n- Choose appropriate time (not during critical operations)\n\n**Execution:**\n1. Announce drill (or unannounced for realism)\n2. Start scenario (simulate kick indication)\n3. Crew responds per procedures\n4. Observe and time response\n5. Note actions taken\n6. Complete drill when objectives met\n\n**Debrief:**\n- Review performance with crew\n- Discuss what went well\n- Identify areas for improvement\n- Answer questions\n- Positive reinforcement for good performance"

      "title": "Evaluation Criteria",
      "content": "**Response Time:**\n- Time from indication to shut-in\n- Target: < 2 minutes typical\n- Compare to previous drills\n\n**Correct Procedure:**\n- Proper sequence followed\n- Right equipment used\n- Communication appropriate\n\n**Equipment:**\n- All equipment functioned\n- Any issues identified\n- Positioning correct\n\n**Team Performance:**\n- Coordination effective\n- Communication clear\n- Leadership appropriate\n- All roles understood"
