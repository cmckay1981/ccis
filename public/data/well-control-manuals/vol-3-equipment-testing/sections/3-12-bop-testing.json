      "content": "BOP testing ensures equipment will function when needed:\n\n**Types of Tests:**\n- Pressure tests (verify seal integrity)\n- Function tests (verify operation)\n- Response time tests (verify speed)\n\n**Regulatory Basis:**\n- API RP 53 provides industry guidance\n- Local regulations specify requirements\n- Company standards may exceed regulatory minimum\n\n**Key Principle:**\nTesting must be rigorous enough to verify function but not so frequent as to cause unnecessary wear."

      "title": "Initial Testing",
      "content": "**When Required:**\n- New BOP installation\n- After stack pulled and reinstalled\n- Before starting drilling operations\n\n**Surface BOP:**\n- Full working pressure test\n- Test all rams and annular\n- Test choke and kill lines\n- Test accumulator capacity\n- Function test all controls\n\n**Subsea BOP:**\n- Onshore test before deployment\n- Subsea test after landing on wellhead\n- All functions verified\n- Acoustic backup tested"

      "title": "Test Procedures",
      "content": "**Pressure Test Procedure:**\n1. Close preventer to be tested\n2. Isolate test area (close valves)\n3. Apply test pressure from below\n4. Hold for required time (typically 5 minutes)\n5. Observe pressure - should not drop\n6. Record result\n7. Bleed pressure and open preventer\n8. Verify preventer opens fully\n\n**Function Test Procedure:**\n1. Operate preventer close function\n2. Verify closure (indicator or observation)\n3. Note closing time\n4. Operate open function\n5. Verify full open\n6. Note opening time\n7. Record results\n\n**Accumulator Test:**\n1. Record accumulator pressure\n2. Disable pumps\n3. Operate all BOPs (close and open one ram)\n4. Record final pressure\n5. Verify meets minimum requirements\n6. Re-enable pumps"
