      "content": "The Driller's Method is a two-circulation kill procedure:\n\n**First Circulation:**\nCirculate kick out using original mud weight, maintaining constant bottomhole pressure.\n\n**Second Circulation:**\nCirculate kill weight mud through the well.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Can begin immediately (no wait for kill mud)\n- Simpler - constant mud weight during first circulation\n- Lower risk of lost circulation during first circulation\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Two full circulations required\n- Higher casing shoe pressure during first circulation\n- More time overall\n\n**When to Use:**\n- When kill mud not immediately available\n- When time to prepare kill mud would allow excessive gas migration\n- When shoe integrity is adequate\n- When preferred by operator procedures"

      "content": "**Starting:**\n1. Ensure choke operator ready\n2. Open choke slightly\n3. Start pump slowly, bringing up to kill rate\n4. As pump speed increases, close choke to maintain SIDPP constant\n5. Once at kill rate with correct ICP: pump and choke in balance\n\n**During Circulation:**\n- Maintain constant drillpipe pressure (ICP)\n- Choke operator adjusts as needed to maintain pressure\n- Monitor casing pressure - will increase as gas rises\n- Watch for MAASP approach\n- Monitor pit volume - will decrease as kick displaced\n- Record pressures and strokes regularly\n\n**Gas at Surface:**\n- Gas will arrive at surface during first circulation\n- Degasser/separator handles gas\n- Casing pressure may fluctuate\n- Maintain drillpipe pressure constant regardless of casing changes\n\n**Completion of First Circulation:**\n- When original mud returns (strokes complete)\n- Pit volume should be back to original\n- Casing and drillpipe pressures should be equal\n- Both equal to SIDPP (approximately)"

If not ready, either:\n- Wait shut-in (managing migration)\n- Circulate another bottoms-up at original weight"

Begin pumping kill mud\n5. As kill mud enters drillstring, begin reducing drillpipe pressure per schedule\n\n**Pressure Schedule:**\n- As kill mud fills drillstring, DP pressure reduces\n- Follow the kill sheet schedule (pressure vs strokes)\n- Linear reduction from ICP to FCP over strokes to bit\n\n**During Second Circulation:**\n- Follow pressure schedule to bit\n- Once at FCP (kill mud at bit): maintain FCP constant\n- Kill mud now filling annulus - provides increasing overbalance\n- Casing pressure should decrease steadily\n- Continue until kill mud at surface\n\n**Completion:**\n- Kill mud at surface (full circulation complete)\n- Casing pressure should be zero (or minimal)\n- Drillpipe pressure at FCP (pump pressure for kill mud)\n- Stop pumps and flow check"
