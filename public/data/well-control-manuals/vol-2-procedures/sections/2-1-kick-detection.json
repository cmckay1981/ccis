      "content": "Primary indicators are direct evidence of formation fluid entry:\n\n**Flow Rate Increase**\nReturn flow rate exceeds pump rate:\n- Monitor flow line paddle or meter continuously\n- Compare to baseline flow for current conditions\n- Account for lag time changes\n\n**Pit Volume Increase**\nUnexplained increase in active mud volume:\n- Monitor total pit volume continuously\n- Account for all additions/transfers\n- Typical detection threshold: 5-10 bbls\n- High-risk operations: tighter thresholds\n\n**Flow with Pumps Off**\nWell continues flowing after pump shutdown:\n- Most definitive indicator\n- Always perform flow check when suspicious\n- Account for U-tube effect after connections\n\n**Response:**\nAny confirmed primary indicator requires immediate shut-in. Do not wait for multiple confirmations."

      "title": "Secondary Kick Indicators",
      "content": "Secondary indicators suggest possible influx and warrant investigation:\n\n**Drilling Break**\nSudden increase in ROP may indicate:\n- Drilling into higher porosity/permeability zone\n- Drilling into higher pressure zone\n- Formation change\n\n**Connection Gas**\nGas at surface after connections:\n- Some connection gas is normal\n- Increasing trend is concerning\n- Monitor for pattern changes\n\n**Background Gas Increase**\nRising gas levels while drilling:\n- May indicate approaching pressure transition\n- Consider increasing mud weight\n- Increase monitoring frequency\n\n**Chlorides Increase**\nSalt water influx indicator:\n- Monitor mud properties regularly\n- Can indicate formation water entry\n\n**Response:**\nSecondary indicators require heightened awareness, flow checks, and possible mud weight increase. Investigate before continuing."

Stop pulling immediately\n2. Fill hole to confirm level\n3. If still not accepting: flow check\n4. If flowing: shut in\n\n**Flow at Surface**\nMud flowing from well with no pipe movement:\n- Stop all operations\n- Shut in immediately\n\n**Monitoring During Trips:**\n- Continuous pit monitoring\n- Trip sheet maintained\n- Flow check before and after trip\n- Flow check at any suspicion"

Do not break connection\n2. Observe and document\n3. If confirmed: shut in\n4. If uncertain: extended flow check"

Stop pumps\n2. Position kelly/top drive clear of rotary\n3. Observe flow line for minimum 5 minutes\n4. Longer observation for deep wells or high-risk situations\n5. Monitor pit volumes\n\n**Interpreting Results:**\n- No flow, stable pits: Well is static\n- Minor flow, stabilizing: Possible U-tube or thermal effects\n- Continuous flow, pit gain: Well is kicking - shut in\n\n**Documentation:**\nRecord all flow checks with:\n- Time and depth\n- Duration of observation\n- Result (static/flowing)\n- Pit volumes before/after"
