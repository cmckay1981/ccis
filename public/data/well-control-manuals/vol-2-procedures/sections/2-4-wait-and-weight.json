      "content": "The Wait & Weight (Engineer's) Method is a single-circulation kill:\n\n**Concept:**\nKill weight mud is pumped from the start, killing the well in one complete circulation.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Only one circulation required\n- Lower maximum casing pressure (shoe pressure)\n- Less time under pressure\n- More efficient overall\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Must wait for kill mud preparation\n- More complex during first phase (changing DP pressure)\n- Requires accurate pressure schedule\n\n**When to Use:**\n- Kill mud can be prepared in reasonable time\n- Shoe pressure is a concern (tight margin)\n- When preferred by operator procedures"

      "title": "Pre-Circulation Preparation",
      "content": "Before beginning circulation:\n\n**Kill Mud Preparation:**\n- Calculate KWM = Current MW + (SIDPP ÷ 0.052 ÷ TVD)\n- Prepare sufficient volume (well volume + reserve)\n- Verify weight with accurate measurement\n- Mix thoroughly - consistent weight critical\n\n**Kill Sheet:**\n- ICP = SCR + SIDPP\n- FCP = SCR × (KWM ÷ Current MW)\n- Drillpipe pressure schedule (ICP to FCP over strokes to bit)\n- Calculate strokes to bit and total circulation strokes\n\n**Verify:**\n- Stable SIDPP and SICP\n- MAASP will not be exceeded\n- Equipment ready\n- Crew briefed\n\n**While Waiting:**\n- Monitor pressures for gas migration\n- May need volumetric method if migration significant\n- Keep waiting time reasonable"

      "title": "Starting Circulation",
      "content": "**Bringing Pump Up to Speed:**\n1. Open choke slightly\n2. Start pump slowly\n3. As pump speed increases, adjust choke to maintain constant SIDPP\n4. Continue increasing speed until at kill rate\n5. At kill rate: DP pressure should equal ICP\n\n**Critical Point:**\nDuring startup, maintain SIDPP constant. Once at kill rate and stabilized, ICP is the reference.\n\n**Begin Pumping Kill Mud:**\n- Once at ICP and stable, switch suction to kill mud\n- Note stroke count when kill mud enters string\n- Begin following pressure schedule"

      "title": "Drillpipe Pressure Schedule",
      "content": "The key to Wait & Weight is following the pressure schedule:\n\n**Schedule Concept:**\n- As kill mud fills drillstring, it adds hydrostatic pressure\n- DP pressure must decrease correspondingly\n- Linear decrease from ICP to FCP over strokes to bit\n\n**Creating Schedule:**\nCalculate DP pressure at regular intervals (e.g., every 100 strokes):\n- Pressure drop per stroke = (ICP - FCP) ÷ Strokes to bit\n- At stroke X: DP Pressure = ICP - (X × pressure drop per stroke)\n\n**Example Schedule:**\n| Strokes | DP Pressure |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 0       | ICP         |\n| 100     | ICP - 10    |\n| 200     | ICP - 20    |\n| ...     | ...         |\n| At bit  | FCP         |\n\n**Following Schedule:**\n- Choke operator adjusts to match schedule\n- Record actual vs scheduled\n- Small deviations acceptable; large deviations indicate problems"

      "content": "From start until kill mud reaches the bit:\n\n**Drillpipe Pressure:**\n- Follows decreasing schedule\n- Choke operator adjusts to maintain schedule\n- At any point: scheduled pressure = required DP pressure\n\n**Casing Pressure:**\n- Initially increases as gas expands\n- May fluctuate as influx moves\n- NOT the control parameter during this phase\n- Monitor for MAASP approach\n\n**Monitor:**\n- Compare actual DP pressure to schedule\n- Pit volumes\n- Pump performance\n- Gas at surface indicators\n\n**When Kill Mud Reaches Bit:**\n- DP pressure should equal FCP\n- Note the stroke count\n- Transition to next phase"

Stop pumps\n2. Close choke\n3. Observe pressures (5-10 minute minimum)\n4. SIDPP and SICP should both be zero\n\n**If Zero Pressure:**\n- Well is killed\n- Open choke, flow check\n- No flow = well secure\n- Document and debrief\n\n**If Residual Pressure:**\n- May indicate incomplete kill\n- Options: circulate again, increase MW\n- Investigate before proceeding"
