      "content": "High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) wells require enhanced well control practices.\n\n**Definitions (typical industry):**\n- High Pressure: Shut-in pressure > 10,000 psi or MW > 18 ppg\n- High Temperature: BHT > 300°F (150°C)\n- Extreme HPHT: Pressures > 15,000 psi, Temperatures > 350°F\n\n**Why HPHT Is Different:**\n- Higher pressures require higher-rated equipment\n- Temperature affects fluid properties and equipment\n- Smaller kick tolerance (narrow margins)\n- Gas behavior more complex\n- Equipment limitations more critical\n- Consequences of loss of control more severe"

      "title": "Kick Detection Challenges",
      "content": "**Thermal Effects on Mud:**\n- Mud expands when heated (apparent pit gain)\n- Contracts when cooled (apparent loss)\n- Can mask real kicks\n\n**Ballooning:**\n- Formation breathes with pressure changes\n- Appears as flow on connections\n- Not a kick but must be distinguished\n\n**Distinguishing Kicks from Thermal/Ballooning:**\n- Flow decreasing over time = probably ballooning\n- Flow increasing over time = probably kick\n- Use flow checks with careful observation\n- PWD data helps identify true pressure changes\n\n**Conservative Approach:**\n- When in doubt, shut in and observe\n- Better to shut in on ballooning than miss a kick\n- Extended flow checks at HPHT depths"

      "title": "Shut-In Considerations",
      "content": "**Pressure Build:**\n- Pressures will be high - prepare crew mentally\n- SIDPP may approach or exceed 10,000 psi\n- Equipment must be rated for these pressures\n\n**Gas Behavior:**\n- Gas at high pressure is highly compressed\n- Less expansion initially\n- Still expands significantly as it rises\n- Calculations more complex (real gas behavior)\n\n**MAASP:**\n- Calculate carefully considering:\n  - High formation pressure\n  - Limited shoe strength margin\n  - Gas compressibility effects\n- May have very limited working pressure range"

      "title": "Kill Procedures",
      "content": "**Method Selection:**\n- Wait & Weight preferred (lower casing pressures)\n- Driller's Method acceptable but higher shoe stress\n- Must complete calculations accurately\n\n**Kill Weight Mud:**\n- May require very high weights (18+ ppg)\n- Preparation may take time\n- Weight accuracy critical\n\n**Circulating:**\n- Slow pump rates typical\n- Longer circulation times\n- Pump limitations may restrict rate\n- Equipment temperature limits\n\n**Pressure Management:**\n- Very tight tolerance\n- Small errors significant\n- Continuous monitoring essential\n- Expert supervision recommended"
