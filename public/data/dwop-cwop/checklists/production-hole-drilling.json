    "Your drilling window is 0.5 ppg (15.8 to 16.3 ppg) - have you modeled worst-case ECD surge during connections?",
    "MPD is planned for this section - what's your influx response if you detect 0.5 bbl gain?",
    "H2S is prognosed at 500 ppm at reservoir - confirm all crew have completed H2S training and drills?",
    "If you lose MPD capability mid-section, can you continue conventionally or must you set casing?",
    "Kick tolerance at TD is 15 bbls - with gas expansion, what's the surface volume at shoe?",
    "Your connection procedure shows 5-minute flow checks - is this adequate for detecting connection gas in HPHT?"
