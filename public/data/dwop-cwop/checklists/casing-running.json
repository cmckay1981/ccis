    "Your centralization shows 67% standoff - cementing typically needs 75% for good displacement. Is this acceptable?",

    "The programme shows auto-fill float equipment but I don't see it on the rig inventory - has this been ordered?",
    "If casing gets stuck 500m from bottom, what's your contingency? Can you cement at that depth?",
    "Make-up torque is 35,000 ft-lbs but rig tongs are rated to 30,000 - confirm you have correct equipment?"
