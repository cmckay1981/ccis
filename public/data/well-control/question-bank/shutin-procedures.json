      "level": "L3",
      "question": "Identify Hard vs Soft Shut-In procedures.",
      "answer": "Hard Shut-In: Close choke first, pump down, close BOP, then open side outlet. Soft Shut-In: Open choke first, pump down, open side outlet, close BOP, then close choke.",
      "explanation": "Hard = immediate BOP closure (fast but pressure spike). Soft = establish flow path first (slower but gentler)."

        "D": "Side outlet closed; choke line through remote; remote open"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Soft shut-in routes through remote choke (ready to control) with choke OPEN initially to accept flow during BOP closure."

      "level": "L3",
      "question": "Shallow gas is less dangerous because there's more reaction time. True or False?",
      "correctAnswer": "False",
      "explanation": "Shallow gas is MORE dangerous\u2014less overburden, faster migration, rapid expansion, minimal time to react. The opposite is true."

        "A",

        "E"
      ],
      "explanation": "High perm = fast flow = quick stabilization (A), higher SICP (C, more influx), larger kick (E). BHP is formation pressure\u2014permeability doesn't change it. SIDPP reflects formation pressure through mud column.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Shallow gas: DON'T shut in (can fracture). INCREASE pump rate to sweep gas away. Close diverter to direct flow to vent lines. Keep mud moving!"
