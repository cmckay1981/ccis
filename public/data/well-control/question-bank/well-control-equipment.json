        "A",
        "B"
      ],
      "explanation": "Pre-charged accumulators: Fast closure (A) without waiting for pumps, and backup power (B) for emergency. Storage (C) is function, not purpose. Choke is separate system.",

      "level": "L3",
      "question": "Accumulator bottles pre-charged with nitrogen?",
      "correctAnswer": "True",
      "explanation": "Nitrogen provides the stored energy. Hydraulic fluid compresses the N2; when released, N2 expands and pushes fluid to BOPs."

        "C": "All functions",
        "D": "Rams and HCR only"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "High-low bypass sends full 3000 psi to rams and HCR (hydraulic connector release). Annular always gets regulated pressure to prevent element damage."

      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Vent DOWNWIND first (port, since wind is starboard-to-port), then isolate shakers, then close diverter. Sequence: safe vent path \u2192 isolate equipment \u2192 seal."
