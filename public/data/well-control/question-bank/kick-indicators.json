    {

      "question": "First indication that a well is flowing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decrease in pump pressure",
        "B": "Increase in rotary torque",
        "C": "Gas cut mud at shakers",
        "D": "Increase in flow from well"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Increased flow rate is the earliest positive indicator\u2014formation fluid entering displaces mud out. All other signs come later or indicate different conditions."

      "id": "EX4-Q2",
      "level": "L3",
      "question": "Action at drilling break?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stop drilling; flow check",
        "B": "Stop drilling; circulate bottoms up",
        "C": "Stop drilling; shut well in",
        "D": "Reduce WOB; control ROP"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Drilling break = ROP increase = possible new formation. Stop and flow check before proceeding. Don't assume kick (shut in) or ignore it (continue)."
    },

      "question": "Positive kick indicators? (SELECT TWO)",

      },
      "correctAnswers": [
        "A",
        "D"
      ],
      "explanation": "Kick = formation fluid entering = MORE flow out (A) and MORE volume in pits (D). Decreases indicate opposite\u2014losses, not kicks.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Setting alarms at +/- 5 barrels",
        "B": "By-passing shakers",
        "C": "Allowing overflow at shakers",
        "D": "Minimizing mud transfers"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Shaker overflow bypasses pit level monitoring\u2014mud goes overboard, not to pits. Can't detect gain if mud doesn't reach measurement point."

        "B": "Stop drilling; flow check",
        "C": "Stop drilling; shut well in",
        "D": "Stop drilling; call toolpusher"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "POSITIVE indicator = kick confirmed. Shut in immediately. Flow check is for warnings or drilling breaks, not confirmed kicks."

        "D": "Pump high density fluid into annulus"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "8.2 bbl for 15 stands seems low\u2014potential swab without obvious flow yet. Run back to restore hydrostatic and circulate to verify wellbore condition. Don't risk continuing."
