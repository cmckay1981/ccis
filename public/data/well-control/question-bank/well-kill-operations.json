    {
      "id": "EX8-Q1",
      "level": "L3",
      "question": "Match method characteristics: ICP maintained first circulation; Usually lower annulus pressures; Kill mud pumped with influx; Influx circulated before kill mud",
      "answer": {
        "ICP_first_circ": "Driller's Method",
        "lower_annulus_P": "Wait and Weight",
        "kill_mud_with_influx": "Wait and Weight",
        "influx_before_kill": "Driller's Method"
      },
      "explanation": "Driller's: circulate out kick first (ICP maintained), then pump kill mud (influx already out). W&W: kill mud follows kick up annulus (together), reducing annular pressures."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q2",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Kill startup statements? (SELECT TWO)",
      "options": {
        "A": "Maintain constant DP pressure when bringing pump to kill speed",
        "B": "Surface line volume affects when kill mud increases hydrostatic",
        "C": "Bring pump to speed holding casing pressure constant",
        "D": "Surface line volume not needed consideration"
      },
      "correctAnswers": [
        "B",
        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "Hold CASING constant during startup (C)\u2014this maintains BHP. Surface line volume delays kill mud reaching DS (B). DP pressure changes during startup; don't try to hold it.",
      "multiSelect": true
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q3",
      "level": "L3",
      "question": "Gas influx circulation - pit volume trend?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stays same",
        "B": "Decreases",
        "C": "Increases"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Gas expands as it rises. Expansion pushes mud out. Pit volume increases, sometimes dramatically as gas reaches surface."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q4",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Kill mud reaches rig floor 100 strokes after pumps. W&W adjustment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Re-zero counter after 100 strokes",
        "B": "Add 100 strokes to bit-to-surface strokes",
        "C": "Ignore 100 strokes"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The 100 strokes in surface lines don't add hydrostatic to the well. Re-zero when kill mud enters DS so stepdown chart matches actual DS fill."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q5",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Best kill technique for long open section?",

        "C": "Wait and Weight",
        "D": "Volumetric"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Long open hole = more exposure to shoe pressure during gas passage. W&W gets kill mud behind gas, reducing maximum shoe pressure. Driller's has peak pressure later in circulation."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q6",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Driller's Method: Original SIDPP 750, SICP 1000. After first circ: SIDPP 750, SICP 850. Action?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Continue second circulation using Wait and Weight stepdown",
        "B": "Bullhead to reduce SICP to 0",
        "C": "Continue second circulation; hold casing constant until kill mud at bit",
        "D": "Reverse circulate"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SIDPP unchanged (750) confirms formation pressure balanced. SICP dropped (some influx out or compressed). Proceed with W&W stepdown for second circulation\u2014most controlled approach."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q8",
      "level": "L3",

      "options": {
        "A": "Stay same",
        "B": "Decrease",
        "C": "Increase"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Kill mud in DS only\u2014annulus unchanged. Casing pressure maintains BHP against same annular column. Pressure stays constant until kill mud enters annulus."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q9",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Choke adjustment - how long for DP response?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1 second per 1,000 feet",
        "B": "5-10 seconds",
        "C": "5-10 minutes",
        "D": "750 feet per minute"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Pressure wave travels ~1000 ft/sec in mud. 10,000 ft well = ~10 second delay. Don't over-adjust waiting for response."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q10",
      "level": "L3",
      "question": "When is FCP maintained?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Once influx out",
        "B": "Once kill mud passed bit",
        "C": "Once kill mud reaches shoe",
        "D": "While pumping kill mud down"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "FCP = Final Circulating Pressure, maintained after kill mud passes bit. DP pressure constant at FCP for rest of circulation. Before bit: follow stepdown schedule."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q11",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Kick taken 30 stands off bottom. Both pressures 150 psi. Action to restore control?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Strip to bottom; circulate using Driller's Method",
        "B": "Circulate while 30 stands off using Driller's Method",
        "C": "Raise MW 150 psi; circulate using Wait and Weight"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Can't kill effectively off-bottom\u2014kick below bit. Strip pipe to bottom (monitoring pressures), then circulate with proper method. Kill mud needs full circulation path."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q12",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Correct stripping action?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Strip until casing = MAASP; bleed each stand",
        "B": "Bleed DP capacity each stand",
        "C": "Bleed DP closed-end displacement each stand",
        "D": "Bleed DP metal displacement each stand"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Closed-end displacement = volume of steel entering well. Bleed this volume to maintain constant BHP. Open-end (capacity) would over-bleed; metal displacement is a component, not total."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q13",
      "level": "L3",
      "question": "Swab kick - is original mud weight sufficient?",
      "correctAnswer": "True",
      "explanation": "Swab kick occurred because BHP temporarily dropped during trip, not because MW was insufficient. Original MW was maintaining balance\u2014just circulate out the influx."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q14",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "When does Wait & Weight give lower shoe pressure than Driller's?",
      "options": {
        "A": "When DP capacity less than open hole (minus kick)",
        "B": "When DP capacity greater than open hole (minus kick)",
        "C": "Always lower with Wait and Weight"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "W&W advantage: kill mud behind gas. If DS capacity < open hole below shoe, kill mud reaches shoe BEFORE gas does. This gives W&W its advantage. Otherwise, benefit diminishes."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q15",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "If gas expansion prevented, effect on BHP?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stays same",
        "B": "Increases",
        "C": "Decreases"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Preventing expansion maintains gas at high pressure (small volume). As gas rises, that high pressure adds to surface\u2014BHP would increase. That's why we allow controlled expansion."
    },
    {
      "id": "EX8-Q16",
      "level": "L4",
      "question": "Horizontal well - why little difference between SIDPP and SICP?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Influx can't migrate",
        "B": "Same fluid density in horizontal drilling",
        "C": "Same volume inside/outside string",
        "D": "Influx vertical height minimal effect on annular hydrostatic"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Horizontal influx has minimal vertical height. Hydrostatic difference between mud and influx depends on VERTICAL height. Horizontal = little height = little SICP difference from SIDPP."
    },

      "id": "EX8-Q17",
      "level": "L4",

        "A": "Lower than vertical",
        "B": "Higher than vertical",
        "C": "Same as vertical"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "High-angle well: kill mud in DS increases DS hydrostatic, but this is offset by less TVD. Net effect: less pressure required than vertical well of same MD."

      },
      "correctAnswers": [
        "B",
        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "Shoe pressure highest when: gas at shoe (B) - maximum gas height above shoe, and at initial shut-in (C) before any expansion relief. BOP arrival has no shoe significance.",

        "C": "Volume = DP metal displacement of pipe stripped"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Closed-end displacement = steel volume entering hole. Bleed this to maintain constant BHP. Metal displacement is subset; hydrostatic method is volumetric, not stripping."
