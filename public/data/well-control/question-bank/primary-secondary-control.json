        "E": "Mud hydrostatic pressure plus annular pressure loss"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mud hydrostatic pressure is ALWAYS the primary control. BOPs are secondary\u2014you don't want to use them unless primary fails."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "BOPs are secondary control\u2014the backup when mud column can't contain formation pressure."

        "D": "Using mud hydrostatic to balance formation pressure"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "PREVENTION comes from maintaining proper mud weight. Monitoring detects kicks; BOPs respond to kicks. Prevention stops kicks from happening."

      "explanation": "Two barrier philosophy: Primary (mud hydrostatic) + Secondary (BOP/casing/cement). Never operate with single barrier."
