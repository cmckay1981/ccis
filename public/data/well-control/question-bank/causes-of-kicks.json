        "D": "Excess pressure due to annular pressure loss"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Abnormal pressure = formation pressure higher than normal hydrostatic gradient (0.433-0.465 psi/ft for water). This is what catches crews off guard."

        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "Pumping out during trips maintains hole fill and reduces swab effect. Pilot holes detect shallow gas before full-size hole. High overbalance causes losses; rapid drilling increases swab risk.",

        "D": "Reduce pump rate"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Rising cuttings could indicate increased ROP or formation breakdown. Check for flow first (kick?), then circulate slowly to analyze cuttings without inducing losses."

        "D": "Close well in"

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Total losses = no returns. Priority: Keep hole full to maintain hydrostatic. Use water (cheap, available) and record volume to track loss rate. Then address cause."

        "A": "Yes, always",
        "B": "No, depends on mud viscosity",
        "C": "No, depends on mud level drop"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Kicks follow IF the fluid level drops enough to underbalance the formation. A kick-inducing zone must exist AND hydrostatic must drop to that level. Not automatic."

        "C": "When gas at casing shoe"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Gas expands as it rises due to decreasing pressure. At bottom, it's compressed and dense. Only at surface does expansion significantly reduce total hydrostatic column."

        "D": "Lost circulation"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Swabbing = pulling pipe acts like piston, creating suction that reduces BHP. This can pull formation fluid into wellbore (swab kick)."

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Slug is HEAVIER than original mud. When level drops in DS, the heavier slug offsets lighter column above. Net BHP unchanged\u2014that's the point of a slug!"

        "D": "Pull 5 stands; flow check again"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Negative flow check doesn't mean no swab occurred\u2014gas may not have migrated yet. Run back to restore hydrostatic and circulate bottoms up to verify wellbore is clean."

        "B": "Small reduction in BHP",
        "C": "No change"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Drilling gas causes small BHP reduction from gas-cut mud. Not a kick\u2014just entrained gas from cuttings. Significant only if large gas volume enters rapidly."

        "D": "When pill starts into annulus"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "BHP depends on TOTAL column weight. Lighter fluid entering annulus immediately reduces annular hydrostatic, therefore BHP. DS content doesn't directly affect BHP."

      "explanation": "Less return than displacement = mud went somewhere. Not total losses (would be zero returns). Partial losses to formation. Swabbing gives MORE returns, not less."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Gas gradient (~0.1 psi/ft) much lower than water (~0.465 psi/ft). From contact upward, pressure drops less in gas than it would in water\u2014so top of gas is overpressured relative to normal hydrostatic."
