        "A": "Use SICP for kill mud calculation",

        "D": "Pump at kill rate until SICP increases"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Float blocks DP from transmitting pressure. Pump slowly\u2014when SICP starts to rise, you've overcome float resistance. DP reading at that moment = true SIDPP."

        "D": "Cuttings reduce annular hydrostatic"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Influx (gas/oil/saltwater) is lighter than drilling mud. Less hydrostatic in annulus = more surface pressure needed to balance same formation pressure."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Gas migration increases pressure equally on both DS and annulus. Choke leak would affect SICP only. Second influx would show unequal changes."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SICP verifies proper startup\u2014should match calculated ICP when coming to kill rate. Kill mud uses SIDPP. ICP calculation uses SIDPP + SCR."

        "D": "Bleed 1 bbl at time through choke"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Volumetric method: Allow pressure to build (work value, e.g., 200 psi), then bleed HALF through casing to maintain BHP constant. Bleed through choke, not DP."
