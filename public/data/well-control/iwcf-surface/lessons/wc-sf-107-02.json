  "content": "Initial Circulating Pressure is the pressure you'll see on the drill pipe when you start circulating to kill the well. It's the sum of two things: the pressure needed to circulate at kill rate (SCR pressure) plus the formation pressure above what your current mud can handle (SIDPP). The formula is: ICP = SCR Pressure + SIDPP. You establish ICP by slowly bringing up the pump while holding casing pressure constant, then maintaining drill pipe pressure at ICP throughout the first circulation.",
  "formula": {
    "equation": "ICP (psi) = SCR Pressure (psi) + SIDPP (psi)",
    "variables": {
      "ICP": "Initial circulating pressure on drill pipe",
      "SCR Pressure": "Slow circulating rate pressure (recorded before kick)",
      "SIDPP": "Shut-in drill pipe pressure"
    },
    "example": {
      "given": "SCR Pressure = 600 psi, SIDPP = 400 psi",
      "calculation": "ICP = 600 + 400 = 1,000 psi"
    }
  },
  "mcq": {
    "question": "Your recorded SCR pressure at 30 SPM is 550 psi. After taking a kick, SIDPP stabilizes at 325 psi. What should your ICP be?",
    "options": {
      "A": "225 psi",
      "B": "550 psi",
      "C": "875 psi",
      "D": "1,100 psi"
    },
    "correctOption": "C",
    "explanation": "ICP = 550 + 325 = 875 psi. This is straightforward addition. The drill pipe pressure gauge should read 875 psi when you're circulating at kill rate and holding bottom hole pressure constant."
  },
  "openQuestions": [
    "Why is it critical to record accurate SCR pressures before taking a kick?",
    "What would happen if you started circulating before the well had fully stabilized?"

      "answer": "740 psi"

      "problem": "SCR = 850 psi, SIDPP = 0 psi",
      "answer": "850 psi (no kick, just circulating)"
