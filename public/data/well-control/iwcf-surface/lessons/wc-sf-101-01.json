  "content": "Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a column of fluid at rest. It's the foundation of all well control\u2014if you don't understand this, nothing else will make sense. The formula is simple but critical: Hydrostatic Pressure (psi) = Mud Weight (ppg) \u00d7 0.052 \u00d7 True Vertical Depth (ft). The constant 0.052 converts ppg to psi/ft. Remember: we always use TVD, not measured depth, because pressure depends on vertical height, not the path the wellbore takes.",

    "equation": "P (psi) = MW (ppg) \u00d7 0.052 \u00d7 TVD (ft)",
    "variables": {
      "P": "Hydrostatic pressure in pounds per square inch",

    "question": "A well has a mud weight of 10.5 ppg and a TVD of 8,000 ft. What is the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the hole?",

    "explanation": "P = 10.5 \u00d7 0.052 \u00d7 8,000 = 4,368 psi. This is a direct application of the hydrostatic equation. Always multiply MW \u00d7 0.052 \u00d7 TVD."

    "Why do we use TVD instead of measured depth in hydrostatic calculations?",
    "If you increase mud weight by 0.5 ppg in a 10,000 ft well, how much additional hydrostatic pressure do you gain?"
