  "title": "Teams vs Groups",
  "type": "lesson",
  "content": "A team is more than a group of people working in the same area. Teams have shared goals, interdependent tasks, and coordinated effort—each member's success depends on others. Groups can work in parallel with minimal coordination; teams must actively integrate their work. Understanding this distinction determines what coordination behaviors are necessary.",
  "mcq": {
    "question": "Five technicians work in the same facility, each handling their own customers independently. They share a break room and occasionally help each other. Are they a team or a group?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Team—they share a workspace and goals",
      "B": "Group—their work is independent, not interdependent",
      "C": "Team—they occasionally collaborate",
      "D": "Neither—this is just coworkers"
    },
    "correctOption": "B",
    "explanation": "Despite shared space and occasional help, their core work is independent—one technician's success doesn't depend on coordinating with others. This is a group. A team would have interdependent tasks where coordination is essential to success."
  },
  "openQuestions": [
    "Is your current work unit more of a team or a group? What makes you classify it that way?",
    "What would need to change for a group in your organization to function as a true team?"
