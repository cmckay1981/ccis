  "title": "Briefings and Handovers",
  "type": "lesson",
  "content": "Briefings and handovers are structured information transfers at critical transitions. Effective handovers cover current status, recent history, pending actions, and anticipated issues. Using consistent formats (like SBAR: Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) ensures complete information transfer and reduces reliance on memory.",
  "mcq": {
    "question": "A shift handover covers current equipment status thoroughly but doesn't mention that a sensor has been intermittently unreliable. Two hours later, the incoming team makes decisions based on readings from that sensor. What handover element was missing?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Current status—they didn't describe present conditions",
      "B": "Recent history—they didn't cover relevant past events",
      "C": "Pending actions—they didn't list tasks to complete",
      "D": "Anticipated issues—they didn't identify potential problems"
    },
    "correctOption": "B",
    "explanation": "The intermittent sensor unreliability is recent history that affects how current information should be interpreted. Complete handovers include relevant history that might not be obvious from current status alone."
  },
  "openQuestions": [
    "What structured format does your team use for handovers? What elements are most often missed or abbreviated?",
    "Describe a situation where incomplete handover information led to problems. What information was missing?"
