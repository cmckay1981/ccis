  "title": "Human Performance Limits",
  "type": "lesson",
  "content": "Human attention and memory have fundamental limits that cannot be overcome by effort or motivation. Working memory holds only 4-7 items; attention can only focus on one complex task at a time; multitasking is really rapid task-switching with performance costs. Designing work that respects these limits prevents errors; ignoring them guarantees them.",
  "mcq": {
    "question": "An operator is asked to monitor 12 different parameters while simultaneously troubleshooting an equipment issue. They miss an important change in one parameter. What best explains this error?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inadequate training on what to monitor",
      "B": "Task demands exceeded human attention and memory limits",
      "C": "Lack of motivation to monitor carefully",
      "D": "Poor situational awareness skills"
    },
    "correctOption": "B",
    "explanation": "Monitoring 12 parameters while troubleshooting exceeds normal human cognitive capacity. This isn't a training, motivation, or skill issue—it's a mismatch between task demands and fundamental human limits. Better design (fewer parameters, alarms, or additional personnel) is the solution."

  "openQuestions": [
    "What tasks in your work environment regularly exceed human attention or memory limits? How are these currently managed?",
    "How do you personally compensate for memory limitations during complex tasks? (Notes, checklists, technology?)"
