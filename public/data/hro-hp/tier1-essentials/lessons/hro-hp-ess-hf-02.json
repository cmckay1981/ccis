  "content": "Fatigue degrades cognitive performance as severely as alcohol intoxication—being awake 17 hours equals 0.05% blood alcohol; 24 hours equals 0.10% (legally drunk). Fatigue impairs judgment, reaction time, attention, and memory—and critically, it impairs your ability to recognize you're impaired. Self-assessment of fatigue is notoriously unreliable.",
  "mcq": {
    "question": "A team member has been awake for 20 hours during an extended operation. When asked, they say they feel fine and can continue safely. How should this self-assessment be weighted?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Trust their judgment—they know their own state best",
      "B": "Give it moderate weight—fatigue affects people differently",
      "C": "Give it low weight—fatigue impairs the ability to assess one's own impairment",
      "D": "Rely only on visible signs of fatigue like yawning"
    },
    "correctOption": "C",
    "explanation": "A key effect of fatigue is impaired self-assessment. People reliably underestimate their own impairment when fatigued. Objective indicators (hours awake, quality of recent sleep) are more reliable than subjective self-reports."
  },
  "openQuestions": [
    "What objective indicators does your organization use to manage fatigue risk, beyond self-reporting?",
    "Describe a time when you were more fatigued than you initially realized. What eventually made you recognize it?"
