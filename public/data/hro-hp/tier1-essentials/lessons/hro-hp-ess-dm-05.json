  "title": "Time-Critical Decisions",
  "type": "lesson",
  "content": "When time pressure is real, two strategies help: buying time (any action that slows situation deterioration without committing to a solution) and satisficing (choosing the first option that meets minimum requirements rather than searching for the optimal choice). Perfect decisions made too late are worse than good decisions made in time.",
  "mcq": {
    "question": "Alarms indicate a rapidly developing problem. You have two possible responses: one you're confident will work but takes 10 minutes, another might work and takes 2 minutes. The situation will become critical in 5 minutes. What's the best approach?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Implement the 10-minute solution—it's more reliable",
      "B": "Try the 2-minute option first, then the 10-minute if needed",
      "C": "Gather more information before committing to either",
      "D": "Implement both simultaneously"
    },
    "correctOption": "B",
    "explanation": "With 5 minutes until critical, the 10-minute solution won't complete in time. Satisficing means choosing the first adequate option—try the faster solution, and if it fails, you still have time to attempt the slower one."
  },
  "openQuestions": [
    "What techniques do you use to buy time when facing a developing problem? How do you know if they're working?",
    "When is it hardest for you to accept a 'good enough' solution instead of searching for the best one?"
  ]
