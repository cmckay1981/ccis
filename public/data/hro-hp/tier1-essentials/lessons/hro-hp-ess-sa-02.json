  "title": "Active Scanning",
  "type": "lesson",
  "content": "Active scanning means systematically gathering information using structured patterns rather than passive observation. Effective operators use deliberate scan patterns—checking specific indicators in a consistent sequence—to ensure nothing is missed. The discipline of structured scanning is what separates noticing problems early from discovering them only after they've escalated.",
  "mcq": {
    "question": "During a busy shift, you rely on your usual habit of checking whatever catches your attention. A colleague uses a written checklist to monitor the same indicators every 30 minutes. After two hours, who likely has better situational awareness?",
    "options": {
      "A": "You, because flexible attention catches unexpected problems",
      "B": "Your colleague, because structured scanning ensures consistent coverage",
      "C": "Equal, since both approaches detect the same information",
      "D": "Neither, scanning frequency matters more than method"
    },
    "correctOption": "B",
    "explanation": "Structured scanning ensures all critical indicators are checked regularly, regardless of what seems interesting at the moment. Attention-driven scanning tends to miss slowly developing problems that don't immediately stand out."
  },
  "openQuestions": [
    "What is your current scanning pattern during routine operations? Is it structured or opportunistic?",
    "Which indicators in your work environment are most likely to be missed without deliberate, scheduled checking?"
  ]
