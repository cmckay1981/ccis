    "HRO-HP-ESS-SA-01": {
      "title": "Situational Awareness on Drill Floor",
      "mcq": {
        "question": "A driller monitoring the control panel sees all parameters in normal range but hasn't considered the formation change expected at current depth. What level of situational awareness are they demonstrating?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Complete situational awareness",
          "B": "Level 1 only—perception without comprehension or projection",
          "C": "Adequate SA for drilling operations",
          "D": "No situational awareness"
        },
        "correctOption": "B",
        "explanation": "Seeing normal gauges is perception (Level 1). Full SA requires understanding the drilling context and anticipating how formation changes might affect parameters."
      }

    "HRO-HP-ESS-DM-01": {
      "title": "Decision Types During Drilling Operations",
      "mcq": {
        "question": "Unexpected gas shows appear while drilling. Procedures exist for gas shows, but the magnitude and rate are unusual. What type of decision is required?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Routine—follow gas show procedures",
          "B": "Tactical—requires judgment within well control principles",
          "C": "Critical—this is potentially an emergency requiring immediate action",
          "D": "No decision needed—wait for company man guidance"
        },
        "correctOption": "C",
        "explanation": "Unusual gas behavior with unknown magnitude requires treating this as potentially critical. Well control situations can escalate rapidly; waiting for guidance may be too slow."
      }
    },
    "HRO-HP-ESS-COMM-04": {
      "title": "Closed-Loop Communication During Connection",
      "mcq": {
        "question": "The driller calls 'Set slips' to the floorhand. What closed-loop response demonstrates proper verification?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Okay.",
          "B": "Setting slips—slips set.",
          "C": "Roger.",
          "D": "Done."
        },
        "correctOption": "B",
        "explanation": "Proper closed-loop: acknowledge instruction, state action being taken, confirm completion. Single word acknowledgments don't verify understanding or confirm completion."

      "title": "Fatigue on 14-Day Hitch",
      "mcq": {
        "question": "A crew member on day 12 of a 14-day hitch, working 12-hour tours, reports feeling 'fine.' Research shows their cognitive state is likely:",
        "options": {
          "A": "Fine—they know their own limits",
          "B": "Minor fatigue that experience compensates for",
          "C": "Significantly impaired, possibly unaware of impairment",
          "D": "Only affected if they report feeling tired"
        },
        "correctOption": "C",
        "explanation": "Cumulative sleep debt produces significant cognitive impairment even when people report feeling fine. Self-assessment of fatigue is unreliable; impaired people often don't recognize their own degraded state."
