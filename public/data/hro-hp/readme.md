## Why This Matters

**80%+ of workplace incidents involve human error.**

But "human error" is not the cause—it's the symptom. Behind every error is:
- Lost situational awareness
- Flawed decision process
- Communication breakdown
- Team coordination failure
- Leadership gap
- System that didn't account for human limits

This training addresses the root causes, not just the symptoms.
