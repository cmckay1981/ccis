{"lessonId":"DM-106-04","moduleId":"DM-106","courseId":"DM","title":"Building Decision Capability","type":"reflection","content":"Decision-making is a skill that improves with deliberate practice. Study decisions—your own and others'. Review what worked and what didn't. Seek feedback on your decision process, not just outcomes. Build pattern libraries through experience and reflection. Commit to continuous improvement in this critical capability.","scenario":{"story":"You've completed this decision-making module. Looking back at your last month of decisions, you can identify patterns: you tend to decide quickly even when time allows, you rarely seek disconfirming evidence, and you don't document reasoning. You want to improve but aren't sure where to start.","options":{"A":"Focus on all areas simultaneously","B":"Choose one decision behavior to improve, practice it deliberately, then move to the next","C":"Wait until a major decision to apply what you've learned","D":"Your current approach is probably fine—these are minor issues"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Skill development requires focused practice. Choose one behavior (e.g., seeking disconfirming evidence), practice it deliberately on upcoming decisions, build the habit, then address the next area. Trying to change everything at once usually changes nothing."},"openQuestions":["What one decision behavior would most improve your effectiveness if you changed it?","How will you practice and develop that behavior over the next month?","Who can give you feedback on your decision-making process?"]}
