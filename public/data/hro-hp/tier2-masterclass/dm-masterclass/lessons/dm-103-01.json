In operations, this causes you to see what you expect rather than what's actually there. Fight it by actively seeking disconfirming evidence and asking 'what would change my mind?'","mcq":{"question":"You believe a system is operating normally. A reading seems slightly off but could be instrument error. What should you do?","options":{"A":"Assume instrument error since the system is normal","B":"Investigate the anomaly as if your assumption might be wrong","C":"Wait to see if other readings confirm the problem","D":"Note it and continue monitoring"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Confirmation bias would have you dismiss the anomaly. Fighting it means investigating as if your assumption of normal operation could be wrong."},"openQuestions":["Describe a time when confirmation bias affected your assessment.","What techniques do you use to counteract confirmation bias?"]}
