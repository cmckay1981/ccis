Leverage this by training yourself to detect deviations: sounds that shift, readings that move, behaviors that differ from normal. Change is often the first indicator that something is happening. If something feels different, investigate—don't dismiss the feeling.","mcq":{"question":"You've been working near equipment for 30 minutes. The background hum changes pitch slightly but everything else appears normal. What should you do?","options":{"A":"Ignore it—pitch changes are normal","B":"Investigate the change even though instruments show normal","C":"Wait to see if it changes further","D":"Log the observation and continue working"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Change in sensory cues often precedes instrument indications. Your perception detected something; investigate to confirm whether it's significant before assuming it's normal."},"openQuestions":["What sensory changes are most important to detect in your work environment?","Describe a time when noticing a subtle change prevented a larger problem."]}
