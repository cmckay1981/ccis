Gaps in shared SA cause coordination failures, conflicting actions, and missed information. Don't assume everyone sees what you see. Verbalize your SA. Ask teammates for theirs. Shared SA must be actively built and maintained through communication.","mcq":{"question":"Two operators are working together. Operator A notices a developing problem. Operator B is unaware. What's the issue?","options":{"A":"Operator B isn't paying attention","B":"Shared SA hasn't been established—Operator A's perception wasn't communicated","C":"Only one person needs to track the situation","D":"Operator A should handle it independently"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Shared SA requires active communication. Operator A perceived something but didn't share it. The team's SA is only as good as what's communicated, not just what individuals notice."},"openQuestions":["How does your team build shared SA during operations?","When has a gap in shared SA caused problems for your team?"]}
