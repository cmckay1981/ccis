Good operators stay ahead of their systems by continuously predicting near-term future states. Reactive operators are always catching up. Develop the habit of projecting 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and 2 hours ahead. What will conditions be if current trends continue?","mcq":{"question":"You're monitoring a tank that's been filling at a steady rate. What projection should you make?","options":{"A":"Continue monitoring until it's nearly full","B":"Calculate when it will reach capacity and plan for the next action before that time","C":"Wait for the high-level alarm","D":"Check back periodically"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Projection means calculating ahead: when will capacity be reached, what action is required, and when must that action begin? Waiting for alarms is reactive, not projective."},"openQuestions":["How far ahead do you typically think during operations?","What conditions would change your projection timeline?"]}
