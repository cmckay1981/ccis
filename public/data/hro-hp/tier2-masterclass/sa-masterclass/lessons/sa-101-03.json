Distractions, time gaps, and task-switching all erode your mental picture. The operational environment continues changing whether you're paying attention or not. Treat SA like a limited resource that requires constant investment.","mcq":{"question":"An operator steps away from monitoring to take a 5-minute phone call. When they return, what is their SA status?","options":{"A":"Unchanged—the system was stable","B":"Degraded—they need to rebuild their picture of current state","C":"Improved—they're refreshed from the break","D":"Depends on whether anything changed"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"SA degrades during any attention gap.
