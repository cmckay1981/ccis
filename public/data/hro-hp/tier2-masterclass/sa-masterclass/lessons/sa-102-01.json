Active scanning is deliberately seeking critical information using structured patterns. In high-risk operations, passive scanning misses subtle changes that matter. Train yourself to scan with intent, not habit.","mcq":{"question":"An operator glances at the control panel every few minutes but isn't looking for anything specific. They're relying on alarms to notify them of problems. What's the risk?","options":{"A":"No risk—alarms will catch any problems","B":"They may miss developing trends that haven't reached alarm thresholds","C":"This is appropriate for stable operations","D":"Passive scanning is actually more effective for routine monitoring"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Alarms activate at thresholds, not at the start of trends. Passive scanning misses the early development of problems that could be caught and addressed before becoming critical."},"openQuestions":["Do you scan actively or passively during routine operations? How do you know?","What would an active scan pattern look like for your primary work area?"]}
