You fixate on immediate tasks and lose the big picture. Task saturation is recognizable: tunnel vision, skipping items, feeling overwhelmed, loss of time awareness. When saturated, act: delegate, defer non-critical work, or stop to reset priorities.","scenario":{"story":"You're managing a complex startup. Three radio calls come in simultaneously. An unexpected alarm activates. Your supervisor asks for a status update. You notice you've stopped checking the primary trend display. Your mental picture of system state is unclear.","options":{"A":"Push through—you can handle it","B":"Recognize task saturation, prioritize critical items, defer or delegate the rest","C":"Ask everyone to wait while you catch up","D":"Focus on the alarm since it's making noise"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Task saturation requires immediate action to preserve SA on critical items. Prioritize (what matters most right now?), delegate what you can, and defer what can wait. Pushing through or focusing on noise creates SA collapse."},"openQuestions":["What are your personal signs of task saturation?","What do you do when you recognize you're saturated?"]}
