A single reading is a snapshot; multiple readings over time are a trend. Stable readings mean static conditions. Rising or falling readings indicate change. The rate of change tells you how much time you have. Always think in trends, not snapshots.","mcq":{"question":"Temperature reads 160°F. Five minutes ago it was 155°F. Ten minutes ago it was 150°F. What does the trend tell you?","options":{"A":"Temperature is in normal range","B":"Temperature is rising at 1°F per minute and will continue unless something changes","C":"Temperature fluctuates normally","D":"Reading is unreliable"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"The trend shows consistent rise at 1°F/minute. This allows projection: if the limit is 180°F, you have approximately 20 minutes unless you intervene."},"openQuestions":["Do your monitoring systems display trends or just current values? How does this affect your SA?","What trends are most important to track in your operation?"]}
