  "title": "The Three Levels of SA",
  "type": "lesson",
  "content": "Level 1 is perception—detecting cues in your environment. Level 2 is comprehension—understanding what those cues mean. Level 3 is projection—predicting what will happen next. Most operational errors occur at Levels 2 and 3: people perceive correctly but misinterpret or fail to anticipate. Each level builds on the previous; you cannot project accurately without first perceiving and comprehending.",
  "mcq": {
    "question": "You notice a temperature reading of 185°F (Level 1). You know the normal range is 150-170°F and this indicates overheating (Level 2). What would complete Level 3?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Recording the reading in the log",
      "B": "Predicting the system will trip on high temperature in approximately 10 minutes at current rate",
      "C": "Reporting the reading to your supervisor",
      "D": "Checking other temperature readings for comparison"
    },
    "correctOption": "B",
    "explanation": "Level 3 is projection—predicting future state based on current trends. The other options are actions, but projection specifically means anticipating what will happen if current conditions continue."
  },
  "openQuestions": [
    "Which of the three SA levels do you find most challenging to maintain under pressure?",
    "Think of a recent operational situation. Can you identify what you perceived, what you understood, and what you predicted?"
  ]
