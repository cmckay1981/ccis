You can look directly at something and not perceive it if you're expecting something different or focused elsewhere. Acknowledge these limits and use techniques to compensate: verbalize observations, use checklists, and cross-check with teammates.","mcq":{"question":"You're looking for a specific valve tag number. You scan a row of valves and don't see it. What should you consider before moving on?","options":{"A":"The valve isn't there","B":"You may have missed it due to attention blindness—scan again more slowly","C":"Ask someone else where it is","D":"Check a different location"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Attention blindness can cause you to look directly at something and not see it. Before concluding the valve isn't there, slow down and search deliberately rather than scanning quickly."},"openQuestions":["When has expectation bias caused you to miss something that was right in front of you?","What techniques help you overcome perceptual limitations in your work?"]}
