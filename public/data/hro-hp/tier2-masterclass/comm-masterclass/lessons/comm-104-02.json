Effective handovers cover current status, recent history, pending actions, known concerns, and anticipated developments. Both parties must actively engage—passively listening during handover creates gaps.","mcq":{"question":"During shift handover, the outgoing operator mentions 'everything's normal' and leaves. What's the problem?","options":{"A":"No problem—normal operations don't need detail","B":"Critical context may be lost without specific information","C":"Incoming operator can check logs","D":"Brief handovers are more efficient"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"'Normal' is subjective and lacks specifics. What parameters? What happened during shift? Any concerns? Anomalies noticed? Logs don't capture nuance and judgment. Handovers transfer understanding, not just data."},"openQuestions":["What information is most often missed in your handovers?","How do you handle handover when things are abnormal?"]}
