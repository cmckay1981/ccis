Failure can occur at any point: unclear encoding, channel noise, poor decoding, or missing feedback. Effective communicators don't assume the message sent is the message received—they verify through feedback.","mcq":{"question":"You radio an instruction to a colleague. There's no response. What should you assume?","options":{"A":"They heard and understood","B":"Communication may have failed at any point—verify","C":"Radio is broken","D":"They're busy and will respond later"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"No response means potential failure anywhere: they didn't hear, didn't understand, can't respond, or channel failed. Never assume successful communication without verification."},"openQuestions":["Where do communication failures most often occur in your operation?","How do you verify message receipt when you can't see the receiver?"]}
