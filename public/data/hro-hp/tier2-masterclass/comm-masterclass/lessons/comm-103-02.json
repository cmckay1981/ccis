The brief time investment prevents catastrophic miscommunication.","mcq":{"question":"Which situation most requires closed-loop communication?","options":{"A":"Scheduling a meeting time","B":"Adjusting critical process parameters","C":"Discussing general project status","D":"Requesting supplies"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Critical process parameters affect safety and operations. Errors are costly or dangerous. Closed-loop verification is essential. Routine scheduling and status don't carry the same risk."},"openQuestions":["What criteria determine when you use closed-loop communication?","Are there high-risk situations where your team doesn't consistently use closed-loop?"]}
