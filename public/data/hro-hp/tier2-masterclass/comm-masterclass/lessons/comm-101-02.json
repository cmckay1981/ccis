Use specific numbers instead of vague terms ('3 PSI' not 'a little'). Use standard terminology. Avoid pronouns without clear referents ('it,' 'that'). In operations, imprecise communication kills. If your message could be misunderstood, it will be.","mcq":{"question":"Which instruction is clearer: 'Open that valve a bit' or 'Open valve V-2105 two turns counterclockwise'?","options":{"A":"Both are equally clear","B":"The first is clearer because it's shorter","C":"The second is clearer because it's specific and unambiguous","D":"Depends on context"},"correctOption":"C","explanation":"The second instruction specifies which valve, how much, and direction. The first is ambiguous on all three points. Specific, unambiguous instructions prevent errors."},"openQuestions":["What vague terms do you commonly use that could be more precise?","How do you ensure instructions are unambiguous?"]}
