{"lessonId":"COMM-102-03","moduleId":"COMM-102","courseId":"COMM","title":"Listening for Understanding","type":"scenario","content":"Active listening aims for understanding, not just receipt. This means grasping context, intent, and implications—not just literal words. Ask clarifying questions when meaning is unclear. Paraphrase to confirm understanding. The goal is shared mental models, not just transmitted data.","scenario":{"story":"During a briefing, a supervisor mentions 'we might need to adjust the schedule if conditions change.' Some team members interpret this as 'the schedule will probably change.' Others hear 'the schedule is set unless something major happens.' The ambiguity isn't addressed.","options":{"A":"Let it go—people will figure it out","B":"Ask for clarification on what conditions would trigger changes","C":"Assume the supervisor will clarify if it's important","D":"Go with your own interpretation"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Ambiguous communication should be clarified immediately. Different interpretations lead to different preparations and expectations. A quick clarifying question prevents later confusion."}}
