{"lessonId":"COMM-104-03","moduleId":"COMM-103","courseId":"COMM","title":"Structured Handover Tools","type":"scenario","content":"Structured handover formats (SBAR, I-PASS, IMSAFE) ensure consistent information transfer. They prevent reliance on memory and reduce individual variation. The structure itself prompts coverage of essential elements.","scenario":{"story":"Two teams use different handover approaches. Team A uses a structured checklist covering status, concerns, pending tasks, and anticipated issues. Team B relies on experienced operators giving verbal summaries. After a shift change, Team B misses that a critical part is on order and continues operations assuming full capability.","options":{"A":"Team B needs more experienced operators","B":"Structured handovers would have prompted coverage of pending items","C":"Team A's approach is too rigid","D":"This was an unusual oversight"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Structure compensates for human memory limitations and variation. Experienced operators forget things too. The checklist prompt 'pending items/orders' would have surfaced the part issue regardless of who conducted the handover."}}
