{"lessonId":"COMM-101-03","moduleId":"COMM-101","courseId":"COMM","title":"Brevity Without Sacrificing Clarity","type":"lesson","content":"Shorter isn't always better. Brevity that creates ambiguity fails. Include all necessary information; exclude only what's truly unnecessary. The goal is concise completeness—every needed word, no unneeded words. Test your message: does the receiver have everything they need to act correctly?","mcq":{"question":"Which is better: 'Increase flow' or 'Increase flow on pump P-101 to 150 GPM, currently at 125'?","options":{"A":"First—it's brief","B":"Second—it's complete despite being longer","C":"First—receiver should know which pump","D":"Depends on receiver's knowledge"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"The longer message is complete: which equipment, what action, target value, current state. Brevity that omits necessary information causes errors. Complete communication beats short communication."},"openQuestions":["When do you sacrifice completeness for brevity?","How do you determine what information is necessary to include?"]}
