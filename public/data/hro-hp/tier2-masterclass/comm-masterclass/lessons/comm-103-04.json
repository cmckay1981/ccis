Use 'Negative' or 'Wrong' to flag the error, then restate correctly. Never let an incorrect readback stand—that's the moment errors are caught. Embarrassment from correction is trivial compared to consequences of uncorrected errors.","mcq":{"question":"An operator reads back '350 PSI' when you said '315 PSI.' What's the correct response?","options":{"A":"'Close enough'—they'll probably set it correctly","B":"'Negative. Three-one-five PSI'","C":"Hope they heard the original correctly","D":"'Yeah, that's right'"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"35 PSI difference could be significant. Flag the error clearly ('Negative'), then restate the correct value distinctly. Never confirm an incorrect readback."},"openQuestions":["How comfortable are you correcting readback errors from senior personnel?","What happens in your organization when readbacks are incorrect?"]}
