Radio and phone lack visual cues. Video adds some back. Text lacks tone. Each channel has limitations requiring compensation: more explicit confirmation, clearer language, deliberate tone management.","scenario":{"story":"A remote operator sends a text message: 'Pressure is getting high.' The control room interprets this as informational. The operator meant it as an urgent warning. They were waiting for instructions while pressure continued rising to dangerous levels.","options":{"A":"Text messages shouldn't be used for urgent matters","B":"The message lacked urgency markers that would have been clear in voice","C":"Control room should have called back","D":"Both parties share responsibility for the ambiguity"},"recommendedResponse":"D","explanation":"The operator's message lacked explicit urgency ('URGENT: Pressure critical, need immediate guidance'). Control room should have clarified ambiguous situations. Text communication requires explicit urgency and status markers that voice conveys automatically."}}
