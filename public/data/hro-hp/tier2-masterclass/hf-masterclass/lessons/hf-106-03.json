{"lessonId":"HF-106-03","moduleId":"HF-106","courseId":"HF","title":"Procedure Design","type":"scenario","content":"Procedures should be usable: appropriate detail, logical sequence, clear language, realistic in time and workload assumptions. Unusable procedures get ignored or worked around. Compliance requires procedures worth following.","scenario":{"story":"A procedure takes 3 hours to complete properly but is scheduled in 2-hour windows. Operators routinely skip verification steps to finish on time. Management responds to an error by adding more verification steps, making the procedure longer.","options":{"A":"Operators need to follow procedures","B":"The fundamental mismatch between procedure requirements and time allocation needs resolution","C":"Additional verification improves safety","D":"Scheduling is a separate issue"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Procedures that can't be followed as written will be adapted. Adding steps to an already time-impossible procedure makes compliance less likely, not more. The schedule-procedure mismatch is the root issue requiring resolution."}}
