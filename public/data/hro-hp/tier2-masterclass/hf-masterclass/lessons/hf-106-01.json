Controls should be intuitive. Displays should present information as needed. Procedures should flow logically. When systems fight human nature, humans lose—and errors result.","mcq":{"question":"A control panel layout requires operators to constantly reach across unrelated controls to perform common sequences. What's the issue?","options":{"A":"Operators need more training","B":"The design doesn't match how work is actually done","C":"Layout doesn't matter if labeled correctly","D":"Operators should adapt to the design"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Design should support natural work flow. When physical layout conflicts with task sequence, it increases workload, errors, and time. Redesigning to match work patterns is more effective than training people to work against design."},"openQuestions":["Where does equipment design conflict with how work is done?","What changes would make your interfaces more intuitive?"]}
