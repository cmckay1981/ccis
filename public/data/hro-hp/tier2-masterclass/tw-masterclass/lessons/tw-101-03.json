These aren't personality traits—they're practices that can be developed.","scenario":{"story":"Two teams handle similar operations. Team A has skilled individuals who compete for recognition and rarely share information unless required. Team B has mixed experience levels but members actively support each other and share learnings. During a complex situation, Team A's members each solve their piece but miss an interaction between components. Team B catches the interaction through their information sharing.","options":{"A":"Team A needs more skilled members","B":"Team B's collaborative practices produced better outcomes than Team A's individual skill","C":"Team A had bad luck","D":"Complex situations are unpredictable"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Individual competence without coordination leaves gaps. Team B's practices—sharing information, mutual support—created collective capability greater than the sum of parts. Team performance isn't just aggregated individual performance."}}
