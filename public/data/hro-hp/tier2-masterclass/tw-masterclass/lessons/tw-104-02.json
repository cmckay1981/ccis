It's destroyed quickly by inconsistency, blame-shifting, or betrayal. Trust is an asset requiring ongoing investment.","mcq":{"question":"A team member makes a mistake. How should the team respond to build trust?","options":{"A":"Hold them accountable publicly to maintain standards","B":"Focus on learning and prevention rather than blame","C":"Ignore it to avoid conflict","D":"Let management handle it"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Blame responses reduce future error reporting. Learning responses maintain information flow while still addressing the issue. 'What can we learn?' builds trust. 'Whose fault was it?' destroys it."},"openQuestions":["What actions have built trust in your teams?","What has damaged trust, and was it repairable?"]}
