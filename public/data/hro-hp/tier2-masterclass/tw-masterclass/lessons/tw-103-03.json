{"lessonId":"TW-103-03","moduleId":"TW-103","courseId":"TW","title":"Shared Situational Awareness","type":"scenario","content":"Teams need shared understanding of the situation, not just individual awareness. This requires active information sharing, not assuming others know what you know. Different perspectives combined create better collective awareness than any individual view.","scenario":{"story":"During a complex operation, three team members each notice different anomalies. Each assumes the others are aware and monitoring. None share their observations aloud. The anomalies are related and together indicate a developing problem. Individually, none seemed urgent enough to report. Combined, they would have triggered intervention.","options":{"A":"Each member should have reported regardless","B":"The team lacked practices for sharing observations to build collective awareness","C":"More experienced members would have known to share","D":"Some anomalies aren't worth reporting"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Information that seems minor individually may be significant collectively. Teams need explicit practices for sharing observations—brief updates, thinking aloud, cross-checks. Assume others don't know what you know."}}
