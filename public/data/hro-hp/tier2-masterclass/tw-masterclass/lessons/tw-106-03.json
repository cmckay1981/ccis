{"lessonId":"TW-106-03","moduleId":"TW-106","courseId":"TW","title":"Learning as a Team","type":"scenario","content":"Team learning requires deliberate practices: debriefs, after-action reviews, shared reflection. Learning must be explicit—assuming the team absorbed lessons from experience overestimates natural learning. Without structured review, teams repeat mistakes and miss improvement opportunities.","scenario":{"story":"Two teams complete similar projects. Team A finishes and moves to the next task. Team B spends 30 minutes in debrief discussing what worked, what didn't, and what they'd do differently. Six months later, Team A repeats several mistakes from the first project. Team B has measurably improved their process.","options":{"A":"Team A was more efficient by not spending time on review","B":"Team B's investment in structured learning paid dividends","C":"Some teams naturally learn without formal review","D":"Experience is the best teacher regardless of review"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Experience without reflection produces less learning than structured review. The 30-minute investment generated lasting improvements. Team A's 'efficiency' cost them repeated errors. Learning requires deliberate extraction."}}
