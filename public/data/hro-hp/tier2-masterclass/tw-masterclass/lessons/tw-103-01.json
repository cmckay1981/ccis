{"lessonId":"TW-103-01","moduleId":"TW-103","courseId":"TW","title":"Coordination Mechanisms","type":"lesson","content":"Teams coordinate through explicit mechanisms (briefings, protocols, checklists) and implicit mechanisms (shared mental models, anticipation). Effective teams use both: explicit mechanisms for clarity, implicit mechanisms for speed. Neither alone is sufficient.","mcq":{"question":"An experienced team performs well with minimal explicit coordination. A new member joins and struggles. What's likely happening?","options":{"A":"The new member is incompetent","B":"The team relies on implicit coordination the new member hasn't yet developed","C":"Experienced teams don't need coordination","D":"The new member should observe and learn"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Implicit coordination requires shared mental models built through experience. New members lack this. Teams should increase explicit coordination when membership changes until shared understanding develops."},"openQuestions":["What implicit coordination does your team rely on?","How do you help new members develop shared mental models?"]}
