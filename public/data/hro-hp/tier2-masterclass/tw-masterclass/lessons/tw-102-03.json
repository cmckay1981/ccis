{"lessonId":"TW-102-03","moduleId":"TW-102","courseId":"TW","title":"Backup and Cross-Training","type":"scenario","content":"Single points of failure are vulnerabilities. Cross-training creates redundancy—multiple people can perform critical functions. Backup behaviors mean monitoring others' work and stepping in when needed. This isn't distrust; it's resilience.","scenario":{"story":"A specialized team member is unexpectedly absent during a critical operation. No one else can perform their function. The operation must be delayed at significant cost while alternatives are arranged.","options":{"A":"The absent member should have planned better","B":"The team should have developed backup capability for critical functions","C":"Some functions can't have backup","D":"This was unforeseeable"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Absences are foreseeable even if specific timing isn't. Critical functions need backup capability. The investment in cross-training pays off when primary performers are unavailable for any reason."}}
