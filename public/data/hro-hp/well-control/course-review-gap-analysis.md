# Claymore & Colt Well Control Course Review & Gap Analysis

**Prepared for:** Claymore & Colt / Gabriella AI Training System
**Review Date:** November 2025
**Reviewed Against:** IWCF Level 3/4 Drilling Well Control Syllabus (July 2017 v8.0) + IWCF Formula Sheet (May 2024 v3.0)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The existing well control course provides solid foundational content for well control training. However, it requires restructuring and supplementation to serve as exam-preparation material for IWCF certification. The content demonstrates strong operational knowledge but gaps exist in:
- Systematic calculation coverage
- Kill method procedures (step-by-step)
- Subsea-specific content (CLFL, riser operations)
- Practical scenario-based decision exercises
- Level differentiation (L3 vs L4)

---

## 5. Instructional Quality Assessment

### 5.1 Strengths
- **Operational Realism**: Content reflects real-world drilling scenarios
- **Depth on Key Topics**: Formation pressure, barrier theory, gas behavior
- **Risk Management**: ALARP and MOC concepts well integrated
- **CRM Elements**: Some human factors content present
- **Technical Accuracy**: Content appears technically sound

### 5.2 Weaknesses
- **Calculation Practice**: Insufficient worked examples
- **Step-by-Step Procedures**: Shut-in and kill procedures lack detail
- **Level Differentiation**: No clear L3 vs L4 content separation
- **Assessment Integration**: No knowledge checks or scenarios
- **Chat-Based Delivery**: Lessons too long for conversational format
- **Sequencing**: Risk management (Session 05) should come later

### 5.3 Instructional Flow Issues
1. **Session 05 (Risk Management)** too early - should follow technical content
2. **No kill methods section** - critical missing content
3. **Equipment (Session 10)** should precede procedures
4. **No calculation workshop** - formulas scattered

## 7. Exam Sufficiency Evaluation

**Surface Stack (DR-SF):** 60% exam ready
- Missing: Kill methods, shut-in procedures, kill sheet completion
- Needs: More calculation practice, decision scenarios

**Subsea Stack (DR-SS):** 35% exam ready
- Missing: CLFL, riser margin, EDS procedures, subsea equipment detail
- Needs: Complete subsea module addition

---

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Critical Additions Required
1. **Well Control Methods Module** - Driller's, Wait & Weight, Volumetric
2. **Kill Sheet Completion Workshop** - Step-by-step with examples
3. **Shut-In Procedures Detail** - Hard vs soft, drilling vs tripping
4. **Subsea Module** - CLFL, riser margin, LMRP, EDS
5. **Calculation Practice Sets** - All 27 IWCF formulas

### 8.2 Structural Changes
1. Move Risk Management to end (after technical mastery)
2. Add Equipment module earlier (before procedures)
3. Create separate L3 and L4 tracks
4. Add scenario-based decision exercises
5. Break content into chat-sized chunks (5-7 minute lessons)

### 8.3 Human Performance Integration
- Add CRM/crew coordination scenarios
- Include fatigue/stress recognition
- Add communication (SBAR-style) examples
- Include decision-making under pressure scenarios

---

## 9. Recommended Two-Tier Structure

### TIER 1: Essential Knowledge (Exam Focused)
**Target:** Pass IWCF Level 3/4 exam
**Duration:** 20-25 lessons
**Focus:** Formulas, procedures, equipment operation

### TIER 2: Advanced Well Control
**Target:** Operational excellence, leadership
**Duration:** 15-20 additional lessons
**Focus:** Engineering thinking, diagnostics, situational modeling, CRM

---

## 10. Next Steps

1. Create detailed module outlines for Tier 1 and Tier 2
2. Develop calculation practice sets (Surface + Subsea)
3. Write scenario-based decision exercises
4. Create L3/L4 differentiated content
5. Restructure existing content into chat-optimized chunks
6. Add subsea-specific modules
