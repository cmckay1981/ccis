# TIER 2: Advanced Well Control
## Engineering Thinking, Leadership & Situational Mastery

**Purpose:** Develop expert-level well control competency beyond exam requirements
**Prerequisite:** Completion of Tier 1 or existing IWCF certification
**Format:** Chat-based delivery with interactive scenarios
**Total Lessons:** 30 lessons + 10 situational exercises

---

## PHILOSOPHY

Tier 2 transforms well control from "knowing what to do" to "understanding why and adapting when things don't go as planned."

**Key Differences from Tier 1:**
- Engineering reasoning over formula memorization
- Leadership decision-making under pressure
- Diagnostic thinking when data is incomplete
- Complex multi-factor scenarios
- Human performance integration throughout
