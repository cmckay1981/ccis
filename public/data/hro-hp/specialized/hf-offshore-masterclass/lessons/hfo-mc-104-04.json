De-manning without workload reduction increases error risk. Multi-skilling provides flexibility but requires competence verification. Use staffing assessment methods like CRIOP to evaluate whether manning supports MAH control during emergencies.","scenario":{"story":"Staffing is reduced from 3 to 2 personnel per shift in the engine room. Workload remains the same. During an emergency, can two people manage the response that previously required three?","options":{"A":"Yes—they're multi-skilled","B":"Staffing reduction should have included emergency response assessment","C":"They'll manage—emergencies are rare","D":"More overtime will compensate"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Staffing changes require assessment of emergency response capability. Multi-skilling doesn't create additional people. If three were needed for emergencies, two may be inadequate regardless of normal operation competence."},"openQuestions":["Have staffing levels changed on your rig? How was safety impact assessed?","What safety-critical tasks rely on multi-skilled personnel? Are they competent in all roles?"]}
