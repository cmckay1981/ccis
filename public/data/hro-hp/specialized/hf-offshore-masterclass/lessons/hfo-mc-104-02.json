However, 12-hour shifts for 21 consecutive days create significant fatigue. Shift design must account for circadian rhythms, task complexity, and workload peaks. Night shifts are physiologically harder and never fully adapt.","mcq":{"question":"It's day 18 of a 21-day trip, 10 hours into a night shift. A complex non-routine task is required. What should the supervisor consider?","options":{"A":"Assign it—experienced crews can handle it","B":"Assess if fatigue makes it safer to defer to day shift","C":"Assign it but with minimal supervision—they know what to do","D":"It's routine offshore—proceed normally"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Cumulative fatigue at day 18, compounded by night shift and late in shift, creates high error risk. Deferring non-urgent complex tasks is prudent fatigue management."},"openQuestions":["Do you work days or nights? How well do you adapt?","What time of your shift is performance most degraded?"]}
