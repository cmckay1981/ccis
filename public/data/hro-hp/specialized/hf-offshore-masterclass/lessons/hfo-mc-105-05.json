Supervisors allocate work, monitor compliance, manage contractors, and provide leadership. Supervisor competence includes technical skills and non-technical skills: leadership, communication, and performance management. Effective supervision is a critical control for MAH.","scenario":{"story":"A supervisor observes a crew member skipping a step in a safety-critical procedure to save time. The task completes successfully. What should the supervisor do?","options":{"A":"Nothing—the task was successful","B":"Correct the behavior and investigate why the step was skipped","C":"Document it for later review","D":"Counsel the crew member privately after the shift"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Successful outcome doesn't justify procedural deviation. Investigate why: was it time pressure, poor procedure design, lack of understanding, or normalization of deviance? Address the root cause, not just the behavior."},"openQuestions":["What competency standards exist for supervisors on your rig?","How do supervisors balance production pressure against safety-critical compliance?"]}
