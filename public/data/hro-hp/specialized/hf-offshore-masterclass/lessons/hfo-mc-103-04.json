Safety cases must demonstrate how human performance variability is managed. This includes task analysis, error identification, and control measures proportionate to risk. Work-as-done often differs from work-as-imagined—understand actual practice, not just procedures.","scenario":{"story":"A safety case assumes a two-person verification for BOP function tests. In practice, one person performs the test while the second signs off remotely. What HF issue exists in the safety case?","options":{"A":"No issue—the test is completed","B":"Work-as-done differs from work-as-imagined, invalidating the safety case assumption","C":"Remote sign-off is acceptable","D":"Procedures should be updated to match practice"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Safety cases must reflect actual practice. If the assumed two-person verification doesn't happen, the barrier effectiveness is overstated. Either enforce the procedure or reassess risk with actual practice."},"openQuestions":["What workarounds or informal practices exist for safety-critical tasks on your rig?","How does your organization reconcile procedures with operational reality?"]}
