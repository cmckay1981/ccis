    "A_feedback": "Premature EDS when time is available wastes the opportunity to position pipe correctly and possibly secure the well conventionally.",
    "B_feedback": "This is never acceptable. Riser damage from over-angle can lead to uncontrolled release, injured personnel, and environmental disaster.",
    "D_feedback": "Waiting until limits are exceeded means you've already failed. You need lead time for the sequence to complete."

  "advancedNote": "Post-Macondo, EDS systems have multiple backups (deadman, autoshear, acoustic, ROV). But primary execution by the driller remains fastest. Drill this scenario regularly - you won't have time to read the procedure when it's real.",
