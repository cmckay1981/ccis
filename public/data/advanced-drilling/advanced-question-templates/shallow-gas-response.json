  "question": "On {{wellProfile.wellName}}, you are drilling the {{currentSection.section}} section at {{currentSection.settingDepth.tvd}} {{currentSection.settingDepth.unit}} TVD (above BOP installation). You observe rapid pit gain, gas at surface, and drilling fluid being blown out of the hole. What is the correct response?",
  "inputs": {
    "wellProfile": {
      "required": ["wellName", "bopInfo.stackType"]
    },
    "currentSection": {
      "from": "wellProfile.casingProgram[activeSection]",
      "required": ["settingDepth.tvd", "section"]
    },
    "hazard": {
      "from": "wellProfile.hazards where hazardType = 'shallow_gas'"
    }
  },
  "correctSequence": [
    "1. Stop drilling immediately",
    "2. Pick up off bottom",
    "3. Activate diverter (NOT BOP - you don't have one yet)",
    "4. Divert flow overboard or to designated safe area",
    "5. Continue pumping to maintain annular velocity and cool the wellhead",
    "6. Prepare to abandon wellbore if uncontrollable",
    "7. Monitor for fire/explosion hazards"
  ],
  "answerOptions": {
    "A": "Shut in the well using the BOP",
    "B": "Stop drilling, pick up, activate diverter, divert flow overboard, continue pumping",
    "C": "Stop pumping and let the gas dissipate naturally",
    "D": "Weight up mud and continue drilling through the gas zone"
  },
  "correctOption": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "B": "Before BOP installation, you cannot shut in. The diverter allows flow to be directed away from the rig floor. Continued pumping maintains annular velocity and prevents gas accumulation at surface.",
    "A": "The BOP is not installed at this depth - you only have a diverter.",
    "C": "Stopping pumping allows gas to accumulate at surface - extreme fire/explosion hazard.",
    "D": "You cannot weight up fast enough to control a shallow gas flow. Never attempt to drill through an active shallow gas blowout."
  },
  "feedback": {
    "correct": "Correct. Shallow gas before BOP installation means diverter operations only. The goal is to divert gas safely away from the rig while maintaining circulation. You CANNOT shut in - the formation is too weak and you have no BOP.",
    "incorrect": "Before BOP installation, your only well control barrier is the diverter. You cannot shut in shallow gas - the weak formation would fracture. Divert and pump."
  },
  "contextualTip": "On {{wellProfile.wellName}}, shallow gas risk exists in the Pliocene sands. The conductor and surface sections are drilled before BOP installation, making shallow gas the most dangerous hazard - you cannot shut in.",

  "subsea_specific": {
    "note": "On subsea wells, the diverter is located on the vessel. Riser disconnection may be required if the situation becomes uncontrollable."
