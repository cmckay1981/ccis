  "question": "On {{wellProfile.wellName}}, you are drilling the HPHT reservoir section at {{currentSection.settingDepth.tvd}} {{currentSection.settingDepth.unit}} TVD. Kick tolerance is only {{kickTolerance.ktValue}} bbls at {{kickTolerance.influxIntensity}} ppg influx intensity. You take a {{scenario.kickVolume}} bbl kick with SIDPP of {{scenario.sidpp}} psi. Given the limited kick tolerance, what is the PRIMARY concern and appropriate response?",

  "feedback": {
    "manageable": "With {{scenario.kickVolume}} bbls (less than half the {{kickTolerance.ktValue}} bbl kick tolerance), conventional kill should work but requires vigilant monitoring. Gas expansion is still significant in deep HPHT wells.",
    "critical": "With {{scenario.kickVolume}} bbls approaching the {{kickTolerance.ktValue}} bbl limit, you have minimal margin. Prepare alternative kill methods and be ready to switch if casing pressure trends toward MAASP.",
    "emergency": "At {{scenario.kickVolume}} bbls, you've met or exceeded kick tolerance. Circulating this out conventionally will likely fracture the shoe, causing underground blowout. This requires supervisor-level decision making and possibly alternative methods."
  },
  "contextualTip": "On {{wellProfile.wellName}}, the limited kick tolerance in the reservoir section is why the DOP mandates 'highest level well control alertness.' Prevention through early kick detection is far better than managing a kick that exceeds your tolerance.",
  "advancedNote": "L4 supervisors must pre-plan responses for kicks at or near tolerance limits. Know your bullhead rates, volumetric procedures, and when to escalate to shore-based well control specialists.",
