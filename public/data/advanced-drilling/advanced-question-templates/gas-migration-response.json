  "question": "On {{wellProfile.wellName}}, you took a {{scenario.kickVolume}} bbl gas kick at {{currentSection.settingDepth.tvd}} {{currentSection.settingDepth.unit}} TVD and shut in. SIDPP is {{scenario.sidpp}} psi and SICP is {{scenario.sicp}} psi. Due to {{scenario.reason}}, you cannot circulate for at least {{scenario.waitTime}} hours. After 1 hour static, you observe SICP has increased from {{scenario.sicp}} to {{scenario.sicpAfter1hr}} psi while SIDPP remains constant. What is happening and what is your response?",

  "explanation": {
    "phenomenon": "Gas migration. The gas bubble is rising in the annulus due to buoyancy. As it rises into lower-pressure regions, it expands, displacing mud and increasing surface pressure.",
    "sidppConstant": "SIDPP remains constant because formation pressure hasn't changed and there's no gas in the drillstring.",
    "sicpIncreasing": "SICP increases as gas rises and expands in the annulus."
  },
  "correctResponse": {
    "method": "Volumetric Well Control",
    "steps": [
      "Calculate pressure increase from gas migration: ΔP = new SICP - original SICP",
      "Calculate volume to bleed: V = ΔP × Annular Capacity / (MW × 0.052)",
      "Bleed mud through choke in small increments to maintain constant BHP",
      "Allow pressure to build to predetermined increment (typically 100 psi)",
      "Bleed calculated volume",
      "Repeat until circulation is possible"
    ]
  },
  "answerOptions": {
    "A": "Open choke and bleed all pressure increase to return SICP to original value",
    "B": "Keep well shut in - do not bleed anything until you can circulate",
    "C": "Use volumetric method - allow controlled pressure buildup then bleed calculated volumes",
    "D": "Open annular and let gas escape freely to surface"
  },
  "correctOption": "C",
  "feedback": {
    "correct": "Correct. Volumetric method allows you to maintain constant BHP while gas migrates. You allow pressure to build (which temporarily over-pressures BHP), then bleed a calculated volume which reduces BHP back to target. This controlled approach prevents both under-balance (kick expansion) and over-balance at the shoe.",
    "A_feedback": "Bleeding all pressure increase would reduce BHP and allow the kick to expand further. You'd be chasing an ever-growing influx.",
    "B_feedback": "Keeping everything shut in causes continuous pressure buildup. Eventually SICP will exceed MAASP, risking fracture at the shoe and underground blowout.",
    "D_feedback": "Never open the annular with a kick in the well. This is an uncontrolled release."
  },
  "contextualTip": "With MAASP at {{currentSection.maasp}} psi and SICP now at {{scenario.sicpAfter1hr}} psi, you have {{maaspMargin}} psi before reaching shoe limits. Gas will continue migrating - at approximately {{migrationRate}} ft/hr in this mud weight. You need volumetric control.",
  "advancedNote": "Volumetric requires good annular capacity data and discipline. Each bleed must be carefully calculated and measured. Pre-calculate your pressure increments and bleed volumes before you need them.",
