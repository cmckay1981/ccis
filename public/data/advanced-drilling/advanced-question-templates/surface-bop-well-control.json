  "scenario": {
    "context": "You are drilling at {{currentDepth}} m on a land rig with surface BOP. Mud weight is {{mudWeight}} sg. You've just completed a connection and noticed a {{pitGain}} bbl pit gain during flow check.",
    "variables": {
      "currentDepth": {"type": "number", "range": [2500, 3500], "unit": "m"},
      "mudWeight": {"type": "number", "range": [1.40, 1.65], "unit": "sg"},

      "question": "You've confirmed a {{pitGain}} bbl kick and shut in on the surface BOP. SIDPP is {{shutInDrillPipePressure}} psi and SICP is {{shutInCasingPressure}} psi. Calculate your kill mud weight and explain your kill method selection.",

      ],
      "correctResponse": "Kill MW = Current MW + (SIDPP / (0.052 × TVD)). For surface BOP, Wait and Weight is typically preferred as we have direct choke access without riser complications. Verify MAASP at shoe before circulating. Key advantage over subsea: faster response time, no choke line friction losses, direct visual monitoring at BOP."

      "questionId": "SBOP-02",
      "question": "During the kill operation, casing pressure is approaching MAASP. What are your options and how does surface BOP give you more flexibility than subsea?",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Reduce pump rate",
        "Bullheading option",
        "Volumetric method",
        "No choke line friction to account for"
      ],
      "correctResponse": "Options: 1) Reduce pump rate (reduces AFP, lowers casing pressure), 2) Apply volumetric method if gas migration is issue, 3) Bullheading - easier on surface BOP with direct pump access. Surface BOP advantages: No choke line friction losses (can be 500+ psi on subsea), faster choke response, ability to visually monitor BOP, easier access for repairs if needed."

      "correctResponse": "Immediate switch to manual choke operation. Ensure driller maintains constant bottomhole pressure using pump strokes and manual choke adjustment. If manual choke also problematic: 1) Consider pump and bleed method, 2) Maintain well shut in while organizing repair, 3) Contact base for emergency equipment. Land rig consideration: spare parts may be hours away - always verify backup equipment before operations."
