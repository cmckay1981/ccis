If flowing, shut in and assess, 3) Calculate fluid level in annulus, 4) Position bit above suspected loss zone if possible, 5) Begin mixing LCM pill while assessing - don't wait. For total losses, initial pill should be high concentration (40-60 ppb) with sized particulate + fibrous blend."

Next steps: 1) Pump second pill with increased concentration (60-80 ppb) and adjusted particle size distribution, 2) Include fibrous LCM (cedar fiber, synthetic fiber) for better bridging, 3) Allow 30-60 min for settling. Escalation criteria: If no improvement after 3 pills or 500+ bbls LCM, consider gunk squeeze or cement squeeze. Document total LCM volume used - will affect well economics.",
