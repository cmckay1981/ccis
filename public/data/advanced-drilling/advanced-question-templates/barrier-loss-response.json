Pore pressure is {{scenario.porePressure}} ppg. While pulling out of hole for a bit change, returns stop and you observe {{scenario.lossVolume}} bbls lost into the formation.

  "feedback": {
    "correct": "Correct. When you lose returns, you've lost your primary barrier (hydrostatic). First priority is to restore it by filling the hole. But be vigilant - losses can mask a kick. The well may be taking fluid AND taking a kick simultaneously. Stop moving pipe and assess.",
    "A_feedback": "Dangerous. Continuing to pull reduces hydrostatic further and increases swab effect. You're inviting a kick.",
    "C_feedback": "You can't shut in on losses - there's no pressure to hold. Shutting in with a fractured zone below you traps you. Fill first, then assess for flow.",
    "D_feedback": "Running pipe back quickly creates surge pressure which could worsen losses. Move deliberately, fill the hole, monitor."
  },
  "contextualTip": "On {{wellProfile.wellName}}, the tight MW window means losses are a real risk. Lost circulation and kicks can occur simultaneously - this is the most dangerous well control scenario. Always fill the hole and monitor.",
  "advancedNote": "Loss of barrier scenarios require supervisor judgment. There's no single correct answer - you must balance kick risk, loss severity, pipe position, and formation characteristics. Pre-plan your response based on the well's PPFG and hazards.",
