You are {{scenario.strokesCompleted}} strokes into the first circulation (gas is at {{scenario.gasPosition}}). Suddenly, pump #1 fails and cannot be repaired quickly. Casing pressure is {{scenario.casingPressure}} psi with MAASP of {{currentSection.maasp}} psi. What is your response?",

  "feedback": {
    "correct": "Correct. The golden rule: maintain constant BHP. When the pump stops, close the choke to trap the pressure. Switch to backup pump while holding casing pressure constant. If no backup, you may need volumetric method to manage gas migration while static.",
    "A_feedback": "Shutting in is acceptable but remember - gas will continue migrating and pressure will build. You must manage this with volumetric bleed-off.",
    "C_feedback": "Never open the choke when losing circulation capacity - you'll lose BHP and the kick will expand.",
    "D_feedback": "Continuing at a different rate changes your pressure schedule. You need to recalculate or maintain original parameters with backup pump."
  },
  "contextualTip": "With casing pressure at {{scenario.casingPressure}} psi and MAASP at {{currentSection.maasp}} psi, you have {{maaspMargin}} psi margin. If gas is near surface, pressure spikes from migration could exceed MAASP. Pre-plan your volumetric increments.",
