    "context": "You are drilling the 16\" hole section through a known evaporite/salt interval. Current depth is {{currentDepth}} m. The well plan calls for KCl polymer mud at {{mudWeight}} sg transitioning to OBM at the base of salt.",

      "correctResponse": "Mobile salt is likely closing in on the drillstring. Immediate response: increase circulation rate to maximum, work pipe continuously, pump high-viscosity sweeps.

Critical points: Ensure no WBM contamination (affects OBM stability), verify rheology before continuing, confirm environmental permits for OBM discharge."
