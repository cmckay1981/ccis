    "correct": "Correct. H2S adds complexity but doesn't change fundamental well control. You must protect personnel (SCBA, muster non-essential) while continuing well control operations. Ensure H2S scavenger is in the mud and equipment is NACE-rated.",
    "A_feedback": "Incorrect. H2S significantly affects personnel safety protocols during well control. You can't ignore it.",
    "B_feedback": "Incomplete. While personnel safety is critical, abandoning well control could lead to an uncontrolled blowout releasing more H2S. Both must be managed simultaneously.",
    "D_feedback": "Bullheading may be considered but isn't automatic. It could fracture formation or doesn't address the gas already in the wellbore. Controlled circulation with proper PPE is usually preferred."
