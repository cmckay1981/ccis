Current MW is {{currentSection.mudWeight.current}} ppg with {{scenario.currentSBP}} psi SBP applied. Delta flow monitoring detects a {{scenario.deltaFlow}} gpm increase in returns.

    "1. Stop drilling and pick up off bottom",
    "2. Increase SBP using MPD choke to compensate for influx",
    "3. Monitor pit volume and flow rate",
    "4. If influx controlled with SBP < limit, circulate out micro-influx",
    "5. If SBP approaching limit or influx continues, convert to conventional shut-in"

  "answerOptions": {
    "A": "Immediately shut in using conventional BOP procedure",
    "B": "Increase SBP to control influx, monitor, circulate out if contained",
    "C": "Continue drilling and monitor - MPD will handle it automatically",

  "correctOption": "B",
  "feedback": {
    "correct": "Correct. MPD's advantage is the ability to dynamically increase surface back pressure to control small influxes without shutting in. Monitor SBP limit ({{wellProfile.mpdData.surfaceBackPressure.max}} psi max) and pit volumes. If the influx continues growing or SBP approaches limits, convert to conventional shut-in.",
    "A_feedback": "Premature. MPD can handle small influxes by increasing SBP. Only convert to conventional shut-in if the influx exceeds MPD capability.",
    "C_feedback": "Incorrect and dangerous. MPD requires active intervention - you must increase SBP to control the influx.",
    "D_feedback": "This would reduce BHP further and worsen the influx. Never reduce BHP when taking an influx."
  },
  "contextualTip": "On {{wellProfile.wellName}}, the tight mud weight window means conventional shut-in risks fracturing the formation. MPD's dynamic control allows influx management with less formation stress.",
  "advancedNote": "The decision point is when SBP approaches {{wellProfile.mpdData.surfaceBackPressure.max}} psi or pit gain exceeds 10-15 bbls. At that point, the influx has exceeded MPD capability and conventional well control is required.",
