  "description": "High Pressure High Temperature drilling requires specialized procedures, equipment, and decision-making. This module covers the unique challenges of HPHT environments where margins are tight and consequences of error are severe.",
  "objectives": [
    "Understand HPHT classification and equipment requirements",
    "Manage operations within narrow mud weight windows",
    "Recognize and respond to HPHT-specific hazards",
    "Apply heightened well control alertness protocols"

    {
      "topic": "HPHT Classification",
      "content": "HPHT wells are classified by temperature and pressure thresholds. Tier 1: >300°F or >10,000 psi. Tier 2: >350°F or >15,000 psi. Tier 3: >400°F or >20,000 psi. Classification drives equipment ratings, material selection, and operational procedures."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Narrow Mud Weight Windows",
      "content": "In HPHT formations, pore pressure and fracture gradient converge, leaving minimal operating margin. A 1.3 ppg window (like Phoenix-702 at TD) means every 0.1 ppg matters. ECD must be precisely managed - too low risks a kick, too high risks losses."
    },
    {
      "topic": "MAWP Considerations",
      "content": "Maximum Anticipated Wellhead Pressure may approach or exceed BOP ratings in extreme HPHT. When MAWP exceeds equipment limits, prevention becomes the primary barrier - you cannot rely on shut-in. Early kick detection and MPD become mandatory, not optional."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Temperature Effects",
      "content": "High temperatures affect mud properties (thinning, barite sag), elastomers (BOP seals), electronics (MWD/LWD), and personnel (heat stress in enclosed spaces). Mud rheology measured at surface differs from downhole behavior."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Kick Tolerance in HPHT",
      "content": "Limited kick tolerance is the defining challenge. With tight windows, even small influxes risk exceeding formation strength at the shoe. Conventional well kill may not be viable for larger kicks - pre-planned alternatives (bullheading, volumetric) must be ready."

    "Prevention over intervention - avoid kicks rather than rely on killing them",
    "Continuous monitoring - PWD, flow, pit volume at highest sensitivity",
    "Pre-planned responses - know your alternatives before you need them",
    "Crew competency - everyone understands the elevated risk level",
    "Equipment verification - confirm ratings match well conditions"
