Identifying and optimizing PIFs reduces error likelihood. Poor PIFs make even skilled operators unreliable. Good PIFs enable consistent performance.","mcq":{"question":"A well control procedure is rarely used. The driller is fatigued after 11 hours on shift. The BOP panel has inconsistent labeling. How many negative PIFs exist?","options":{"A":"One—fatigue is the only real issue","B":"Two—fatigue and procedure familiarity","C":"Three—infrequent task, fatigue, and poor HMI design","D":"None—these are normal offshore conditions"},"correctOption":"C","explanation":"All three are PIFs: task infrequency (lack of practice), fatigue (reduced cognitive performance), and poor labeling (increased error likelihood). They compound risk."},"openQuestions":["What PIFs most frequently degrade performance on your rig?","How does your organization assess and improve PIFs for safety-critical tasks?"]}
