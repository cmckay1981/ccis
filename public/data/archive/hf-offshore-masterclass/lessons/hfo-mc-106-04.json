Stopping at 'operator error' is inadequate. Ask why the operator made that error—training, procedures, fatigue, design, supervision? Learning from incidents requires HF analysis. Communicate lessons across the organization and implement systemic improvements.","scenario":{"story":"An incident investigation concludes 'driller error caused the event.' The driller was on day 20 of 21, working nights, and the procedure was last revised 8 years ago. What latent factors were missed?","options":{"A":"None—the driller made the error","B":"Fatigue (day 20, night shift), outdated procedure, and possible supervision gaps","C":"The investigation was thorough","D":"These are normal offshore conditions"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Stopping at 'driller error' misses systemic factors: cumulative fatigue, night shift degradation, procedure currency. These latent factors set the conditions for error. Addressing only the individual leaves the system unchanged."},"openQuestions":["Do your incident investigations routinely identify latent organizational factors?","How are HF learnings from incidents communicated and implemented?"]}
