Too many alarms cause alarm fatigue—operators ignore or silence them. Follow EEMUA 191 and IADC drilling alarm guidelines: prioritize alarms, eliminate nuisance alarms, and ensure each alarm is actionable. Poor alarm management has contributed to major incidents.","scenario":{"story":"During a well control event, 47 alarms activate within 90 seconds. The driller acknowledges and silences most of them to focus on well parameters. What alarm management failure occurred?","options":{"A":"Driller should have addressed all alarms","B":"Alarm flood indicates poor alarm prioritization and rationalization","C":"This is normal during well control events","D":"More screens would help"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Alarm floods during critical events indicate poor alarm management. Alarms should be prioritized so only actionable, safety-critical alarms present during emergencies."},"openQuestions":["How many alarms does your drilling or marine control room receive per hour?","What percentage of those alarms are false, nuisance, or informational rather than actionable?"]}
