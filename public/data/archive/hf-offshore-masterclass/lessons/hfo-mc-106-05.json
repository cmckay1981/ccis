Use performance data to drive continuous improvement. Audit HF elements of SEMS regularly. Engage workforce in identifying HF issues and solutions. Mature HF programs evolve based on operational experience.","scenario":{"story":"Near-miss trends show increasing procedural non-compliance on night shifts. What HF performance indicators should be investigated: fatigue, procedure usability, supervision, or workload?","options":{"A":"Fatigue only—night shift is the issue","B":"All four—they interact and compound","C":"Procedure usability—people follow good procedures","D":"Supervision—they should enforce compliance"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Night shift non-compliance could stem from any or all factors: fatigue reducing vigilance, procedures that are hard to follow when tired, reduced supervision coverage at night, or workload peaks. Investigate all systematically."},"openQuestions":["What HF performance indicators does your organization track?","How is workforce feedback on HF issues collected and acted upon?"]}
