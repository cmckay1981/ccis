Watch-keeping demands sustained vigilance. Control room design must support situational awareness, minimize fatigue, and enable rapid emergency response. Lighting, noise, and workspace ergonomics all affect performance.","mcq":{"question":"A DP operator monitors six screens during a critical operation. Two alarms activate simultaneously on different screens. What HMI issue is this?","options":{"A":"Operator error—should have been more attentive","B":"Poor information integration—critical alarms should be centralized","C":"Normal workload—operators should handle it","D":"Alarm system working correctly"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Spreading critical information across multiple displays increases cognitive load and slows response. Alarm integration principles require prioritization and centralization."},"openQuestions":["Does your marine control room design support 12-hour watch-keeping without excessive fatigue?","What environmental factors (noise, lighting, temperature) affect marine crew performance?"]}
