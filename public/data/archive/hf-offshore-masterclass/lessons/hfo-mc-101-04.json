{"lessonId":"HFO-MC-101-04","moduleId":"HFO-MC-101","courseId":"HFO-MC","title":"Design Verification and Commissioning","type":"scenario","content":"HF objectives specified during design must be verified during construction and commissioning. Walk-throughs, mock-ups, and usability testing catch design compromises before operations begin. Verify that valves, panels, and escape routes meet HF specifications. Don't assume design intent survived construction.","scenario":{"story":"During commissioning, you discover critical valves are blocked by newly installed piping. The design drawings show clear access. What went wrong with the HF integration process?","options":{"A":"Construction followed drawings—this is acceptable","B":"HF verification wasn't performed during construction","C":"Piping is more important than valve access","D":"Operators will adapt"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Design intent must be verified during construction. HF walk-throughs during installation would have caught this deviation before commissioning."},"openQuestions":["How does your organization verify HF requirements during commissioning?","What design intent has been compromised during construction on projects you've seen?"]}
