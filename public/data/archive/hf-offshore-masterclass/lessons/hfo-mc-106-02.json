Each topic requires evidence proportionate to MAH risk. For heritage rigs, demonstrate what's been done and justify where full compliance is impractical. New builds must meet current standards.","mcq":{"question":"A 20-year-old rig operates in the UKCS. Control room layout doesn't meet ISO 11064. What should the safety case demonstrate?","options":{"A":"Nothing—it's a heritage asset, standards don't apply","B":"Why full compliance is impractical and what alternative measures are in place","C":"Plan to retrofit to full compliance immediately","D":"That the rig operates safely despite non-compliance"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Safety cases for heritage assets should explain why full compliance is impractical (cost, lifecycle) and demonstrate alternative risk controls that achieve ALARP."},"openQuestions":["Which of the 14 HF topics are strongest in your safety case? Which are weakest?","For older rigs, how do you justify deviations from current HF standards?"]}
