The earlier HF is integrated, the more cost-effective and safer the final system. Without an HFIP, human performance issues surface late when fixes are expensive or impractical.","mcq":null,"openQuestions":["Does your organization have a formal HFIP for new builds or major modifications?","What HF issues could have been prevented if addressed during design rather than operations?"]}
