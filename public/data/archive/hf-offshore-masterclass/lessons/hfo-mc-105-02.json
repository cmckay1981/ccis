Major accidents have occurred when permits weren't communicated across shifts or between contractors and operators. Shift handovers transfer situational awareness—face-to-face handovers are better than logs alone. Use structured formats like SBAR. Verify the incoming shift understands active permits and system status.","mcq":{"question":"During shift handover, the outgoing supervisor mentions 'a few permits active, nothing major.' What's the problem?","options":{"A":"No problem—permits are logged in the system","B":"Too vague—incoming supervisor needs specific permit details and hazards","C":"Normal—permits are operational routine","D":"Incoming supervisor should check the log independently"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Vague handovers fail to transfer critical situational awareness. Specific permit details, hazards, and work status must be communicated face-to-face."},"openQuestions":["How are active PTW permits communicated during shift handover?","What information is most often missing or unclear during handovers?"]}
