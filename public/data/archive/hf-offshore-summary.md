## Key Differentiators from General HF Course

| **General HF Course** | **HF Offshore Course** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Individual performance focus | System-level integration |
| Error types (slips, lapses, mistakes) | HRA, PIFs, barrier management |
| General workplace ergonomics | MODU design, control room standards (ISO 11064, EEMUA 201) |
| Basic fatigue concepts | 21-day rotations, FRMP, CRIOP analysis |
| General shift work | Offshore-specific 12-hour patterns |
| Foundational/Intermediate | Advanced/Regulatory compliance |
| Broad industry application | Drilling & marine operations specific |
| No regulatory framework | UK SCR 2015, IADC, OSDR requirements |
