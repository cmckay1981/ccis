'We've come this far' isn't a reason to continue if conditions no longer support the plan. Evaluate decisions based on what's ahead, not what's behind. Past costs are irrelevant to future decisions.","mcq":{"question":"You're 80% through a procedure when conditions change, making completion risky. You've invested significant time. What should guide your decision?","options":{"A":"Complete it—you're almost done","B":"Evaluate whether continuing is justified by current conditions, ignoring time already spent","C":"Speed up to finish before conditions worsen","D":"Continue since stopping wastes the effort"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Time spent is a sunk cost and irrelevant to the forward decision. Only current conditions and future prospects should determine whether to continue or stop."},"openQuestions":["When has sunk cost influenced you to continue something you should have stopped?","How do you recognize when you're committing to a losing course?"]}
