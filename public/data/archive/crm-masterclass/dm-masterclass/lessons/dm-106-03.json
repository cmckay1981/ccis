You didn't document your reasoning at the time. What's the risk?","options":{"A":"You'll have to rely on memory","B":"Hindsight bias will make the decision appear worse than it was given information available","C":"No significant risk","D":"You should have consulted more people"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Without documentation, reviewers evaluate with full hindsight while you made the decision with limited information. Documentation captures what you knew and considered at decision time."},"openQuestions":["What decisions do you document?
