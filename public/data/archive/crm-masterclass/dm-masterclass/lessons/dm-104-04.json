Under extreme stress, you may miss obvious information, forget important factors, and focus only on immediate survival. Recognize stress effects and use countermeasures: slow your breathing, verbalize your thinking, and follow established procedures.","scenario":{"story":"During a rapidly developing abnormal situation, you notice your heart racing, your focus narrowing, and difficulty thinking beyond the next few seconds. Multiple alarms are sounding. You feel the urge to do something immediately but aren't sure what.","options":{"A":"Act on your first instinct to address the most obvious problem","B":"Take 5 seconds to slow your breathing, verbalize what you see, and reference your emergency procedures","C":"Call for help and wait for assistance","D":"Address alarms one at a time starting with the loudest"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"The scenario describes acute stress response. Taking a brief moment to slow breathing reduces physiological stress, verbalizing creates structure, and referencing procedures leverages pre-made decisions rather than deciding under stress."},"openQuestions":["How does stress affect your decision-making?","What techniques help you maintain decision quality under stress?"]}
