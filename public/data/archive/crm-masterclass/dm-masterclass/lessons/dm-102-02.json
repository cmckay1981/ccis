{"lessonId":"DM-102-02","moduleId":"DM-102","courseId":"DM","title":"Recognition-Primed Decision Making","type":"lesson","content":"Experts rarely list options and compare them analytically. Instead, they recognize patterns and mentally simulate the first workable option. If simulation shows failure, they move to the next option. This recognition-primed approach is faster and more reliable than formal analysis under time pressure.","mcq":{"question":"An experienced operator smells something unusual and immediately thinks 'overheating bearing.' What's happening?","options":{"A":"They're guessing","B":"Pattern recognition from similar past situations","C":"Jumping to conclusions","D":"Following procedure"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"This is recognition-primed decision making. The operator's experience created pattern libraries that allow rapid identification of situations without formal analysis."},"openQuestions":["Describe a time you 'just knew' what was happening. What pattern did you recognize?","How do you build pattern recognition capability in yourself or others?"]}
