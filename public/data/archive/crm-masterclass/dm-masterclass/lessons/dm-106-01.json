You might have been lucky. Evaluate whether the process was sound—did you consider risks, have good information, follow appropriate methods? Process quality matters more than single outcomes."},"openQuestions":["When has a good outcome masked a poor decision process?","How do you evaluate decision quality separately from outcomes?"]}
