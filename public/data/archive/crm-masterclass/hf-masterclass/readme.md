## Modules

### HF-101: Human Performance Fundamentals
Understanding the capabilities and limitations of human performance in operational environments, including attention, memory, and perception.

### HF-102: Fatigue Management
Understanding fatigue causes, effects, and countermeasures for maintaining performance during extended or demanding operations.

### HF-103: Stress and Performance
Managing stress effects on performance, including acute stress responses, chronic stress impacts, and effective coping strategies.

### HF-104: Cognitive Biases
Recognizing and mitigating the cognitive shortcuts and biases that can lead to errors in judgment and decision-making.
