{"lessonId":"HF-103-03","moduleId":"HF-103","courseId":"HF","title":"Managing Stress in Real-Time","type":"scenario","content":"Real-time stress management includes recognition, breathing techniques, cognitive reframing, and deliberate process use. The first step is awareness—recognizing stress symptoms in yourself enables conscious intervention.","scenario":{"story":"During an operational upset, a supervisor notices their heart racing and thoughts fragmenting. They're about to make rapid decisions. Instead of acting immediately, they take three deep breaths, state the situation aloud to organize thinking, then proceed through their decision framework methodically. The team notices the controlled approach and follows suit.","options":{"A":"The pause wasted valuable time","B":"The deliberate stress management prevented rushed errors and modeled composure","C":"Experienced operators don't need such techniques","D":"The physical symptoms should have been ignored"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Brief stress management interventions—breathing, verbalization, structured process—take seconds but prevent stress-driven errors. The supervisor's visible composure also influenced team state. Acting immediately under stress often produces worse outcomes than brief deliberate pause."}}
