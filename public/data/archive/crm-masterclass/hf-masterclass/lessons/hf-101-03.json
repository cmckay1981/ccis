{"lessonId":"HF-101-03","moduleId":"HF-101","courseId":"HF","title":"Memory: Working and Long-Term","type":"scenario","content":"Working memory holds approximately 7 items briefly. Long-term memory stores vast information but retrieval is imperfect and influenced by context. Relying on memory for critical operational information is a design flaw—use checklists, references, and documentation.","scenario":{"story":"An operator must remember a six-step procedure executed quarterly. They remember five steps, skip the third, and execute in wrong order. The procedure has existed for years but is only documented informally.","options":{"A":"The operator needs more training","B":"Infrequent, complex procedures require documented references, not memory","C":"Experience should prevent this","D":"The procedure should be simplified"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Memory degrades with time and infrequency. Complex procedures executed quarterly will have recall errors regardless of training. Documented checklists compensate for memory limitations and ensure consistent execution."}}
