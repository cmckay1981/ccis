{"lessonId":"HF-106-04","moduleId":"HF-106","courseId":"HF","title":"Continuous Human Factors Improvement","type":"reflection","content":"Human factors is not a one-time design exercise but ongoing attention to how people actually work within systems. Conditions change, technology evolves, and new failure modes emerge. Organizations that continuously monitor and improve human-system fit outperform those that design and forget.","mcq":{"question":"After implementing human factors improvements, performance is good. What should happen?","options":{"A":"Move to other priorities—the problem is solved","B":"Continue monitoring because conditions change and new issues emerge","C":"Document success and close the project","D":"Human factors work is complete once implemented"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Systems drift, people change, conditions evolve. Today's good design becomes tomorrow's error trap as context shifts. Continuous monitoring, feedback collection, and improvement maintain human-system fit over time."},"openQuestions":["How does your organization monitor human factors issues over time?","What process exists for continuously improving human-system fit?"]}
