Monitoring is cognitively demanding and humans are poor at sustained vigilance. Automation can also reduce skill maintenance. Effective automation supports humans rather than replacing their judgment entirely.","mcq":{"question":"A highly automated system requires operators only during failures. Why is this problematic?","options":{"A":"It's not—automation is reliable","B":"Operators lose skills and situational awareness needed to intervene effectively during failures","C":"Operators prefer active roles","D":"Automation failures are simple to handle"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Ironies of automation: it's most needed during failures but degrades the human capability to handle them. Passive monitoring erodes skills and awareness. Design should keep operators appropriately engaged."},"openQuestions":["How does automation affect skill maintenance in your operation?","What keeps operators engaged enough to intervene effectively?"]}
