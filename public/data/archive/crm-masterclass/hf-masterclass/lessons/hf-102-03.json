{"lessonId":"HF-102-03","moduleId":"HF-102","courseId":"HF","title":"Fatigue Countermeasures","type":"scenario","content":"Effective fatigue countermeasures include adequate sleep, strategic napping, caffeine timing, task rotation, environmental factors, and workload management. There is no substitute for sleep, but countermeasures can partially mitigate unavoidable fatigue.","scenario":{"story":"An operation requires 16-hour coverage with two operators on a remote site. They've been splitting 8-hour shifts. A critical phase requires both present for 12 hours. By hour 10, both are making errors—slow responses, missed checks. They push through to completion.","options":{"A":"Dedication and professionalism got the job done","B":"The operation should have planned for fatigue management during the critical phase","C":"Two operators should have been sufficient","D":"Errors are normal and acceptable"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Predictable high-demand periods need fatigue planning: pre-rest, scheduled breaks, task rotation, additional personnel. Pushing through degraded performance is accepting elevated risk. The errors in hours 10-12 could have been prevented."}}
