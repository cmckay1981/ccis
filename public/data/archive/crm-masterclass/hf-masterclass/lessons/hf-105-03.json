{"lessonId":"HF-105-03","moduleId":"HF-105","courseId":"HF","title":"Error Prevention Strategies","type":"scenario","content":"Error prevention uses multiple strategies: elimination (remove error opportunity), substitution (less risky methods), engineering controls (physical barriers), administrative controls (procedures, training), and personal protective equipment. Higher-level controls are generally more effective.","scenario":{"story":"Similar-looking valves have been confused in the past, causing incorrect operations. Management responds by: (A) adding labels, (B) additional training, (C) reminders to be careful, (D) physically redesigning handles to be distinguishable by touch.","options":{"A":"Labels are sufficient","B":"Training solves knowledge gaps","C":"Physical redesign most effectively prevents confusion errors","D":"All approaches are equally effective"},"recommendedResponse":"C","explanation":"Physical redesign (engineering control) prevents the error regardless of attention, training, or label reading. Labels can be missed; training degrades; reminders are ignored under pressure. Engineering solutions that eliminate error opportunity are most robust."}}
