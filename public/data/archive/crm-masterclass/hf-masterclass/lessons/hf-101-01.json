Unlike machines, humans excel at pattern recognition, adaptation, and judgment—but have limited attention, imperfect memory, and systematic biases. Effective operations design around human strengths while mitigating human limitations.","mcq":{"question":"Why is understanding human limitations essential for operational safety?","options":{"A":"To replace humans with automation","B":"To design systems and procedures that account for predictable human performance","C":"To identify who to blame when errors occur","D":"Human limitations can be trained away"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Human limitations are predictable, not personal failings. Systems designed assuming perfect human performance will fail. Accounting for limitations—through automation, procedures, cross-checks—creates reliability despite imperfection."},"openQuestions":["What human limitations most frequently affect your operations?","How does your operation design around known human limitations?"]}
