{"lessonId":"HF-104-03","moduleId":"HF-104","courseId":"HF","title":"Anchoring and Availability","type":"scenario","content":"Anchoring biases decisions toward initial information even when irrelevant. Availability bias overweights easily recalled examples—recent, dramatic, or personal experiences seem more probable than they are. Both distort risk assessment and decision-making.","scenario":{"story":"A team assesses risk for an operation. A dramatic incident occurred recently at another site involving a specific hazard. The team focuses extensively on that hazard while giving less attention to more probable risks that haven't had recent incidents.","options":{"A":"They're appropriately learning from recent events","B":"Availability bias is overweighting a vivid recent event over more probable risks","C":"Recent incidents are the most important risks","D":"Risk assessment should focus on dramatic hazards"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"The recent incident makes that hazard 'available' mentally, inflating perceived probability. Meanwhile, statistical risk data might show other hazards are more likely. Structured risk assessment using data, not just memory, counters availability bias."}}
