People don't come to work intending to fail. Errors emerge from conditions: poor design, inadequate training, time pressure, fatigue, ambiguous information. Understanding error requires understanding context.","mcq":{"question":"An operator makes an error that causes an incident. What's the most useful question?","options":{"A":"Who is responsible?","B":"What conditions made this error possible or likely?","C":"How do we discipline the operator?","D":"Was this negligence?"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Blaming the operator answers nothing useful and prevents recurrence. Understanding conditions—interface design, procedures, workload, supervision—reveals systemic factors that, if addressed, prevent future errors by anyone in similar conditions."},"openQuestions":["How does your organization investigate errors?","What conditions make errors more likely in your workplace?"]}
