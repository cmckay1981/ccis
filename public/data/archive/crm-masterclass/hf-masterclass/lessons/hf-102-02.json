Alertness and capability are lowest between 2-6 AM, regardless of sleep. Night work fights biology. Understanding circadian effects enables scheduling that minimizes risk during vulnerable periods.","mcq":{"question":"An operation requires critical decisions at 4 AM. What should be true about staffing?","options":{"A":"Normal staffing—time of day doesn't matter with training","B":"Enhanced oversight and conservative decision thresholds due to circadian vulnerability","C":"Reduced staffing since operations are usually quieter at night","D":"4 AM is like any other time"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"4 AM is in the circadian trough—lowest performance regardless of sleep. Critical decisions during this period need extra safeguards: additional review, conservative thresholds, cross-checks. Biology doesn't yield to training or willpower."},"openQuestions":["How does your organization account for circadian effects?","What safeguards exist for decisions made during night shifts?"]}
