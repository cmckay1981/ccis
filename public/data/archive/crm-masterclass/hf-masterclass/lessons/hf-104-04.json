Structured processes (checklists, frameworks), diverse perspectives, and explicit challenge requirements create systematic bias resistance that doesn't depend on individual cognition."},"openQuestions":["What structured processes does your team use to counter biases?","How do you ensure diverse perspectives inform important decisions?"]}
