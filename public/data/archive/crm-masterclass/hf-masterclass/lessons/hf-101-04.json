Expectations influence what we see. We miss what we don't expect. We see patterns in noise. Understanding perceptual limitations enables compensation through verification and multiple perspectives.","mcq":{"question":"You expect to see a normal reading on an instrument. The reading is abnormal but you report it as normal. What happened?","options":{"A":"Equipment malfunction","B":"Expectation influenced perception—you saw what you expected","C":"Carelessness","D":"The reading was ambiguous"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Expectation powerfully shapes perception. We literally see what we expect, especially in quick glances. This is why cross-checks and deliberate verification exist—to catch expectation-driven misperception."},"openQuestions":["When has expectation caused you to miss something?","How do you verify perceptions against expectations?"]}
