{"lessonId":"HF-101-02","moduleId":"HF-101","courseId":"HF","title":"Attention and Its Limits","type":"lesson","content":"Attention is a limited resource. Humans can focus on approximately one demanding task at a time. Multitasking is actually rapid task-switching, and each switch has a cost. When demands exceed capacity, performance degrades—often without awareness that degradation is occurring.","mcq":{"question":"You're monitoring two complex systems simultaneously. Both require attention at the same moment. What happens?","options":{"A":"You divide attention equally","B":"One system gets attention while the other is neglected","C":"Practice allows true simultaneous attention","D":"Automation prevents this problem"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Attention doesn't divide—it switches. One system gets focus while the other goes unmonitored. This happens even when we believe we're monitoring both. Design should prevent simultaneous demands on single operators."},"openQuestions":["When has limited attention caused problems in your work?","How does your operation manage competing demands for attention?"]}
