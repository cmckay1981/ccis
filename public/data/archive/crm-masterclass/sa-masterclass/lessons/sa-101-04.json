{"lessonId":"SA-101-04","moduleId":"SA-101","courseId":"SA","title":"Why SA Fails","type":"scenario","content":"Understanding why SA fails helps you recognize early warning signs and take corrective action before errors occur. Most SA failures aren't sudden—they're gradual degradations that go unnoticed until it's too late.","scenario":{"story":"During a routine operation, an experienced operator is managing multiple systems while also training a new team member. A subtle pressure anomaly develops over 15 minutes. The operator's attention is split between answering questions and monitoring. An alarm finally sounds, but by then the pressure has exceeded safe limits and emergency procedures are required. Post-incident review shows the trend was visible on instruments the entire time.","options":{"A":"The operator was incompetent and should have noticed sooner","B":"SA degraded gradually due to divided attention, and the operator didn't recognize the degradation","C":"The alarm system failed by not activating earlier","D":"The new team member was too demanding of attention"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"This is classic SA failure: gradual degradation from attention competition without recognizing the degradation is occurring. The operator wasn't incompetent—they were managing competing demands and lost awareness of their own SA state. The trend was perceivable; comprehension and projection failed because attention resources were depleted."},"openQuestions":["Have you experienced SA failure due to divided attention? What were the warning signs you missed?","How do you balance training others while maintaining your own SA?"]}
