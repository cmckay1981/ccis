The outgoing operator has hours of accumulated SA. The incoming operator starts with zero. Effective handovers transfer not just system status but also trends, concerns, anticipated events, and active hazards.","scenario":{"story":"You're handing over a shift. The system is currently stable, but 45 minutes ago you noticed an unusual vibration in a pump that hasn't recurred. You also expect a delivery truck in 2 hours that will require traffic management. The relief operator asks 'anything I need to know?'","options":{"A":"System is stable, nothing unusual","B":"System is stable now. Two things: pump showed unusual vibration earlier—it resolved but watch it. Also, delivery coming in 2 hours, will need traffic management.","C":"Everything's normal, it's been quiet","D":"Check the pump occasionally"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Effective handover transfers your SA: current state (stable), concerns (pump vibration), and anticipated events (delivery). The incoming operator now starts with SA rather than having to build it from zero."},"openQuestions":["What information do you need most when taking over a shift?","What gets lost in handovers at your workplace?"]}
