{"lessonId":"SA-103-03","moduleId":"SA-103","courseId":"SA","title":"Updating Mental Models","type":"lesson","content":"Your mental model must evolve as new information arrives. When what you perceive contradicts your model, you face a choice: update the model or reject the information. Confirmation bias pushes you toward rejecting contradictory data. Fight this tendency. If reality doesn't match your model, your model is probably wrong.","mcq":{"question":"You expect a valve to be closed based on the procedure. You check it and it appears closed. Later, you discover it was actually open. What mental model error occurred?","options":{"A":"You didn't look carefully enough","B":"Expectation bias caused you to see what you expected rather than what was actually there","C":"The valve was mislabeled","D":"Someone opened it after you checked"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Expectation bias is a comprehension error. Your mental model said 'valve is closed,' so you perceived confirmation of that model rather than carefully evaluating actual position."},"openQuestions":["How do you know when to trust your mental model versus when to question it?","What recent information should cause you to update your mental model of your operation?"]}
