When pressure reaches X, do Y. When time reaches T, stop the operation. Establish triggers in advance so you don't have to make decisions under pressure. When the trigger is met, act—don't debate. Projection without predetermined action points is just observation.","mcq":{"question":"You're monitoring weather during outdoor operations. What approach best uses decision triggers?","options":{"A":"Monitor conditions and decide when to stop based on how things look","B":"Establish specific trigger points (wind speed, lightning distance) that require automatic work stoppage","C":"Wait for the safety officer to make the call","D":"Continue until conditions become uncomfortable"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Predefined triggers remove decision-making under pressure. When wind hits 25 mph, stop—no debate required. This is projection plus predetermined action."},"openQuestions":["What decision triggers exist in your operation? Are they clearly defined?","What triggers should you establish that don't currently exist?"]}
