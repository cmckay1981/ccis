What will happen if you take this action? What could go wrong? What's your contingency? Mental simulation catches errors before they occur in reality. It costs nothing but seconds and can prevent serious mistakes. Make simulation a habit before every significant action.","mcq":{"question":"You're about to close a valve to isolate a section for maintenance. Before closing it, what should you do?","options":{"A":"Verify the valve tag matches the procedure","B":"Mentally simulate what will happen when you close it—pressure changes, flow effects, downstream impacts","C":"Get a second person to witness the action","D":"Check that tools are available for maintenance"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Mental simulation before action catches potential problems. Will closing this valve cause pressure buildup elsewhere? Will something downstream lose flow unexpectedly? Simulate before you act."},"openQuestions":["How often do you mentally simulate actions before taking them?","Describe a time when mental simulation prevented a mistake."]}
