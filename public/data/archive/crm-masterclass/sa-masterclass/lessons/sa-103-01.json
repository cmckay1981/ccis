It includes components, relationships, normal states, and expected behaviors. The accuracy of your mental model determines how well you understand what you perceive. Inaccurate models lead to misinterpretation—you see something but draw the wrong conclusions because your model is wrong.","mcq":{"question":"An operator has a detailed mental model of how a pump system works. When they see unusual vibration, they immediately consider bearing failure. An operator without this model might see the same vibration and think nothing of it. What does this illustrate?","options":{"A":"Experience makes you more nervous","B":"Mental models enable comprehension of perceived cues","C":"Vibration is always a sign of bearing failure","D":"New operators should be more concerned about equipment"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"The detailed mental model allows the experienced operator to comprehend what vibration might mean. Without the model, the same perception doesn't lead to understanding."},"openQuestions":["How accurate is your mental model of the systems you operate? How do you know?","What gaps exist in your mental models that you should address?"]}
