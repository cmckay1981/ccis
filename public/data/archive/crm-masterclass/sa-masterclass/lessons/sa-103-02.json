A high pressure reading during startup might be normal; the same reading during steady-state operation might indicate a problem. Comprehension requires interpreting cues within their context—operating phase, recent activities, environmental conditions, and system history all matter.","mcq":{"question":"You observe a crew member running across the work area. What determines whether this is concerning?","options":{"A":"Running is always unsafe and should be stopped","B":"Context: emergency vs. late for break vs. responding to radio call","C":"Their role determines whether running is appropriate","D":"Time of day indicates whether it's normal"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Running could indicate emergency response (urgent), being late (benign), or responding to a call (depends).
