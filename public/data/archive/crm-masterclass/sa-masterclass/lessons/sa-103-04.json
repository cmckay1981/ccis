A combination of readings, sounds, and behaviors that individually seem unremarkable might form a pattern indicating impending failure. Pattern recognition comes from experience and deliberate attention to how situations unfold. When experienced operators say 'something doesn't feel right,' they're often recognizing a pattern subconsciously.","mcq":{"question":"An experienced operator says 'this feels like the time we had that pump failure' even though no alarms are active. What's happening?","options":{"A":"They're being paranoid","B":"They're pattern-matching current conditions to previous incidents","C":"They should wait for instrument confirmation","D":"Experience makes operators overly cautious"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"This is recognition-primed comprehension. The operator's experience has created pattern libraries that allow them to recognize developing situations before formal indicators appear."},"openQuestions":["What patterns have you learned to recognize from experience?","How can you accelerate pattern recognition development in yourself or others?"]}
