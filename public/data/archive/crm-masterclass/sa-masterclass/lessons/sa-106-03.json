It catches errors before they become incidents. Good teams actively monitor each other's SA and speak up when someone seems to be losing the picture. This requires trust, mutual respect, and a culture where challenging each other's SA is expected, not offensive.","mcq":{"question":"You notice a teammate seems focused on a minor task while a more critical parameter is drifting. What should you do?","options":{"A":"Let them handle their area—it's not your concern","B":"Alert them to the critical parameter: 'Hey, looks like pressure is trending up'","C":"Take over their monitoring","D":"Report to the supervisor"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Cross-monitoring means helping teammates maintain SA. A brief alert preserves their autonomy while ensuring critical information isn't missed. This is teamwork, not interference."},"openQuestions":["Do you feel comfortable challenging a teammate's SA?
