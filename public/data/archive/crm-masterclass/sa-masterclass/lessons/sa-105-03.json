Routine breeds inattention. The more familiar an operation, the more likely you'll stop actively maintaining SA. Complacency is insidious because it develops gradually from success—nothing has gone wrong, so you reduce vigilance. Fight it by treating every operation as if it could go wrong.","mcq":{"question":"You've completed the same procedure 50 times without incident. What's the SA risk?","options":{"A":"Lower risk due to experience","B":"Higher risk due to potential complacency","C":"No change in risk","D":"Risk depends on the procedure complexity"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Repeated success builds complacency. You may start skipping checks or reducing attention because 'it always works.' This creates vulnerability precisely when experience should provide protection."},"openQuestions":["Where has complacency affected your SA in routine operations?","How do you stay vigilant during familiar, repetitive tasks?"]}
