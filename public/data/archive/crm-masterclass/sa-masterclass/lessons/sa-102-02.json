It ensures nothing gets skipped during routine checks. Good scan patterns start with safety-critical items, include all key parameters, and can be completed in a reasonable time. Random scanning creates gaps; disciplined patterns create completeness.","mcq":{"question":"What's the primary purpose of using a consistent scan pattern?","options":{"A":"It looks more professional","B":"It prevents you from skipping critical monitoring points","C":"It satisfies regulatory requirements","D":"It makes scanning faster"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Scan patterns ensure completeness. When you follow the same route consistently, you don't accidentally skip items, especially under stress when attention narrows."},"openQuestions":["Do you have a defined scan pattern for your work area? If not, what would one include?","How often should you complete a full scan cycle in your environment?"]}
