{"lessonId":"SA-105-02","moduleId":"SA-105","courseId":"SA","title":"Fatigue and SA Degradation","type":"lesson","content":"Fatigue degrades all three SA levels. Perception narrows, comprehension slows, and projection fails. The worst part: fatigue makes you less aware of how impaired you are. You feel fine until you're not. Recognize fatigue warning signs early—difficulty concentrating, irritability, tunnel vision. Take countermeasures before SA collapses.","mcq":{"question":"Which SA level degrades first under fatigue?","options":{"A":"Level 1 (Perception)","B":"Level 2 (Comprehension)","C":"Level 3 (Projection)","D":"All levels equally"},"correctOption":"C","explanation":"Projection requires the highest cognitive effort. Under fatigue, we lose the ability to think ahead first, then comprehension suffers, and finally perception narrows."},"openQuestions":["What are your personal warning signs that fatigue is affecting your SA?","What countermeasures do you use when fatigue starts affecting your performance?"]}
