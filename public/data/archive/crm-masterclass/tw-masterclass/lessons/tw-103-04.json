{"lessonId":"TW-103-04","moduleId":"TW-103","courseId":"TW","title":"Coordination Under Pressure","type":"lesson","content":"Coordination often fails when most needed—under time pressure and stress. Teams revert to individual focus, communication decreases, and shared awareness fragments. Countering this requires deliberate practice and explicit protocols that maintain coordination when instinct says to focus inward.","mcq":{"question":"During an emergency, team communication naturally decreases as members focus on their tasks. Is this a problem?","options":{"A":"No—focus is appropriate in emergencies","B":"Yes—reduced coordination risks uncoordinated actions and missed information","C":"Only if tasks are interdependent","D":"Communication should be minimal in emergencies"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Emergencies require more coordination, not less. Uncoordinated actions can conflict or miss interactions. Brief, structured communication maintains coordination: 'I'm doing X. Status is Y. Need anything?' keeps the team connected."},"openQuestions":["How does coordination change in your team under pressure?","What practices help maintain coordination during high-stress situations?"]}
