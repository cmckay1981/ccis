{"lessonId":"TW-104-03","moduleId":"TW-104","courseId":"TW","title":"Psychological Safety","type":"scenario","content":"Psychological safety means team members feel safe to take interpersonal risks—speak up, question, admit confusion, challenge ideas—without fear of punishment or humiliation. It's not about comfort; it's about enabling the candor teams need to perform.","scenario":{"story":"A team has two members with concerns about a plan. One works with a leader who thanks people for raising issues. That member speaks up. The other works with a leader who responds to concerns with irritation. That member stays silent. The spoken concern reveals a flaw; the unspoken one doesn't—until it causes a problem.","options":{"A":"Both members should speak up regardless of leader behavior","B":"Leader responses directly determine whether team members voice concerns","C":"The silent member was at fault","D":"Some concerns aren't worth raising"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"People rationally assess the risk of speaking up. Leaders who respond poorly teach silence. Leaders who respond well teach candor. Psychological safety is created by leader behavior, not declarations."}}
