Teams coordinate, not just coexist. In operations, groups fail under pressure—teams adapt. The difference is intentional design: shared goals, defined roles, mutual accountability, and collective commitment to outcomes.","mcq":{"question":"Five workers share a workspace but work independently on unrelated tasks. Are they a team?","options":{"A":"Yes—they work together","B":"No—they lack interdependence and shared purpose","C":"Yes—proximity makes a team","D":"Depends on their job titles"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Teams require more than proximity. Without shared goals, interdependence, and mutual accountability, they're a group. Co-location isn't coordination."},"openQuestions":["What distinguishes your team from a mere collection of individuals?","Where have you seen groups fail where teams would have succeeded?"]}
