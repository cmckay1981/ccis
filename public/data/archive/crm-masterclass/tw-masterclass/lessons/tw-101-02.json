Most teams cycle through these repeatedly as membership or conditions change. Understanding the stage helps leaders provide appropriate support.","mcq":{"question":"A new team is experiencing disagreements about how to approach work. What stage is this?","options":{"A":"Forming—they're still getting oriented","B":"Storming—natural conflict as roles and methods are negotiated","C":"Dysfunction—conflict indicates problems","D":"Performing—productive debate"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Storming is normal and necessary. Teams that skip it often have suppressed conflict that emerges worse later. The goal is working through it to norming, not avoiding it."},"openQuestions":["What stage is your current team in?","How do you recognize when a team has regressed to an earlier stage?"]}
