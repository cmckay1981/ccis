{"lessonId":"TW-105-03","moduleId":"TW-105","courseId":"TW","title":"Conflict Resolution Approaches","type":"scenario","content":"Conflict can be addressed through avoiding (withdrawal), accommodating (yielding), competing (winning), compromising (splitting), or collaborating (integrating). Different situations call for different approaches. Collaboration produces the best outcomes but requires more time and skill.","scenario":{"story":"A team faces a decision where two members strongly disagree. Option A optimizes for speed, Option B for quality. Under time pressure, the leader imposes Option A without discussion. The decision is fast but Option B's proponent disengages, and quality issues later cause delays exceeding what Option B would have taken.","options":{"A":"The leader made the right call given time pressure","B":"Taking time to explore both positions might have found a better solution or built commitment","C":"Option B proponent should have accepted the decision","D":"Time pressure justifies competitive resolution"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"Competing (forcing) gets quick decisions but loses information and commitment. Brief exploration—'What quality issue worries you most?'—might have identified a quick fix or built buy-in. Time saved on decision was lost to poor execution."}}
