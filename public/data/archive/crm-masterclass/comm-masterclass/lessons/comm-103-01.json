This closed loop catches errors before they cause problems. It takes seconds longer but prevents minutes or hours of error correction.","mcq":{"question":"You instruct a technician to set pressure to 250 PSI. They respond 'Setting pressure to 250.' What's missing?","options":{"A":"Nothing—they confirmed receipt","B":"Your confirmation that their readback was correct","C":"The specific equipment identification","D":"A written record"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Three-way communication requires sender confirmation. Without it, you don't know if they heard correctly. The third step closes the loop: 'Correct, 250 PSI.'"},"openQuestions":["In what situations do you skip the third confirmation step?","What errors has three-way communication caught in your experience?"]}
