In high-reliability operations, silence kills. When you see a problem, saying nothing makes you part of the problem. Assertiveness isn't rudeness—it's responsibility.","mcq":{"question":"You notice a senior operator about to make an error. You're new to the team. What should you do?","options":{"A":"Stay quiet—you might be wrong and they're experienced","B":"Speak up clearly and immediately","C":"Mention it later if it causes a problem","D":"Tell someone else to address it"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Hesitation costs time and potentially safety. Your experience level doesn't change what you observed. Speak up directly: 'I see X, which concerns me because Y.' Let them evaluate your input."},"openQuestions":["What makes you hesitate to speak up about concerns?","How does your organization respond when junior people raise concerns?"]}
