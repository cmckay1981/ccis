{"lessonId":"COMM-103-03","moduleId":"COMM-103","courseId":"COMM","title":"Effective Readbacks","type":"scenario","content":"Readbacks should include the essential elements: who, what, where, when, and critical values. Don't just parrot—demonstrate understanding. If unsure, say so. A questioning readback is better than an incorrect confident one.","scenario":{"story":"Control instructs: 'Unit 7, reduce main pump flow to 450 GPM over the next 10 minutes.' The operator responds: 'Copy, reducing flow.' They begin reducing flow on Unit 8's auxiliary pump immediately.","options":{"A":"The readback was adequate—they confirmed the action","B":"The incomplete readback allowed three errors to go undetected","C":"Control should have been more specific","D":"The operator understood the intent"},"recommendedResponse":"B","explanation":"The readback omitted unit number (wrong unit), pump identification (wrong pump), target value, and timeframe (immediate vs. gradual). A complete readback—'Unit 7, reducing main pump flow to 450 GPM over 10 minutes'—would have revealed all errors before action."}}
