{"lessonId":"COMM-105-02","moduleId":"COMM-105","courseId":"COMM","title":"Graded Assertiveness","type":"lesson","content":"Assertiveness can escalate: inquiry, advocacy, assertion, emergency intervention. Start by asking questions ('Are you aware that...?'). If unaddressed, state your concern directly. If still ignored and safety is at risk, take action. The gradient provides options while maintaining the ability to stop unsafe acts.","mcq":{"question":"You've stated a concern twice and been dismissed. The situation is worsening. What's next?","options":{"A":"Accept their judgment—they have more authority","B":"Escalate to stronger assertion or direct intervention","C":"Document your concern and step back","D":"Wait for someone else to intervene"},"correctOption":"B","explanation":"Authority doesn't override safety. If graduated assertiveness hasn't worked and risk is escalating, stronger intervention is required. 'I need you to stop. This is unsafe.' Document later."},"openQuestions":["Have you ever had to escalate beyond initial assertiveness?","What would make you physically intervene in an unsafe situation?"]}
