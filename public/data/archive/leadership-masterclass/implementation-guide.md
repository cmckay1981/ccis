- Lessons within modules can be flexible

---

## Content Differentiation from CRM Courses

### No Overlap With:
- **Situational Awareness (SA)** - Different focus (hazard detection vs leadership capability)
- **Decision Making (DM)** - Leadership decisions vs operational decisions
- **Communication (COMM)** - Strategic communication vs operational communication
- **Teamwork (TW)** - Leading teams vs being team member
- **Human Factors (HF)** - Leadership factors vs individual performance factors

### Unique Leadership Focus:
- Vision and strategy
- Delegation and development
- Accountability systems
- Influence without authority
- Organizational systems
- Executive-level transitions

---

## Delivery Recommendations

### Pacing
- 1-2 lessons per session recommended
- Reflection lessons should have extended time
- Scenario lessons benefit from discussion (if group setting)

### Application
- Each lesson includes open questions for reflection
- Encourage learners to document specific actions
- Module completion should include development goal setting

### Assessment
- MCQs test decision-making judgment, not memorization
- No single "right answer" culture - focus on reasoning quality
- Reflection questions reveal self-awareness depth
