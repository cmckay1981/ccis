## What Each Competency Uniquely Teaches

### Situational Awareness (SA)
**The perception and mental model foundation**

- Three-level SA model (perception, comprehension, projection)
- Active vs. passive scanning techniques
- Building and updating mental models
- Recognizing threats to awareness
- Team situational awareness and handovers
- Detecting hazards before alarms

**Key Differentiator:** SA teaches you to *see* what matters.

---

### Decision Making (DM)
**The operational decision process**

- Decision types (routine, tactical, critical)
- Decision models: OODA, recognition-primed, structured analysis
- Cognitive bias recognition and mitigation
- Time-critical decision-making
- Team decision processes
- Post-decision analysis

**Key Differentiator:** DM teaches you *how to decide* operationally.

---

### Communication (COMM)
**Operational communication protocols**

- Communication model fundamentals
- Active listening and verification
- Closed-loop protocols (three-way communication)
- Briefing and handover structure
- Assertive communication across authority gradients
- Context adaptation (stress, cross-cultural)

**Key Differentiator:** COMM teaches operational protocols.

---

### Teamwork (TW)
**Team dynamics from the member perspective**

- Team vs. group distinction
- Team formation and development stages
- Role clarity and responsibility management
- Coordination and workload distribution
- Trust and psychological safety as a member
- Constructive conflict management
- Team resilience

**Key Differentiator:** TW teaches you to be an effective team member.

---

### Leadership (LEAD)
**Complete leadership capability development**

- Leadership operating system (mental models)
- Building and maintaining credibility
- Leading under pressure
- Developing people through delegation and coaching
- Accountability without toxicity
- Team dynamics from leader's perspective
- Strategic leadership and vision
- Leadership decision-making (ethics, delegation)
- Influence without authority
- Advanced communication (crisis, difficult conversations)
- Self-leadership (blind spots, burnout)
- Organizational systems (succession, talent)

**Key Differentiator:** Leadership as a distinct capability.

---

### Human Factors (HF)
**Universal human performance principles**

- Attention, memory, perception limits
- Fatigue physiology and countermeasures
- Stress impacts on performance
- Cognitive biases as universal shortcuts
- Error types (slips, lapses, mistakes)
- Human-system integration design

**Key Differentiator:** HF teaches *why* humans make errors.

---

### Human Factors for Offshore Drilling (HFO-MC)
**Industry-specific regulatory compliance**

- HFIP development and implementation
- MODU design and control room evaluation
- Human Reliability Analysis for drilling
- Offshore rotation and fatigue management
- UK Safety Case Regulations 2015 compliance
- IADC standards implementation

**Key Differentiator:** The ONLY course meeting UK offshore regulatory requirements.

## FAQ: "Don't these courses overlap?"

**Q: Both DM and LEAD cover decision-making. What's the difference?**
A: DM teaches decision *process* (OODA, biases, time-critical techniques). LEAD teaches decision *responsibility* (what to decide yourself vs. delegate, ethics, stakeholder management).

**Q: Both COMM and LEAD cover communication. What's the difference?**
A: COMM teaches operational *protocols* (closed-loop, briefings). LEAD teaches *strategic* communication (crisis messaging, organizational change, difficult conversations).

**Q: Both TW and LEAD cover teams. What's the difference?**
A: TW teaches how to be an effective team *member*. LEAD teaches how to *create* effective teams as a leader.

**Q: Both HF and HFO-MC cover human factors. What's the difference?**
A: HF teaches universal principles for any industry. HFO-MC applies those principles to offshore drilling regulatory requirements.

**Q: If I take all courses, will I learn anything twice?**
A: No. Topics appearing in multiple courses are addressed at different levels or perspectives. The portfolio is designed with zero duplication.
